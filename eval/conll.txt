Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing
what is genetic risk ?
Genetic risk refers more to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease
People get certain disease because of genetic changes
how much a genetic change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear
if your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease
the opposite is also true
if your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it is still possible that you develop heart disease
However for some rare diseases , people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease
when we are diagonosed out with certain genetic disease , are we suppose to disclose this result to our relatives ?
my answer is no
on one hand , we do not want this potential danger causing firghtenning affects in our families ' later lives
when people around us know that we got certain disease , their altitudes will be easily changed , whether caring us too much or keeping away from us
and both are not what we want since most of us just want to live as normal people .
surrounded by such concerns , it is very likely that we are distracted to worry about these problems
it is a concern that will be with us during our whole life , because we will never know when the " potential bomb " will explode .
on the other hand , if there are ways can help us to control or cure the disease , we can going through thses process from the scope of the whole family
for an example , if exercising is helpful for family potential disease , we can always look for more chances for the family to go exercise
and we keep track of all family members health conditions
at the same time , we are prepared to know when there are other members who got this disease
Here I want to share Forest'view on this issue
although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington 's disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings , there currently is no legal requirement to do so
in fact , requiring someone to communicate his or her own genetic risk to family members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be ethically dubious
"
nothing is absolute right or wrong .
if certain disease genetic test is very accurate and it is unavoidable and necessary to get treatment and known by others , it is OK to disclose the result
Above all , life is more important than secret
Genetic risk does carry its consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle
afterall , what affects one family may or may not affect another although the families has a common genetic make up , shared by either of the parents
in cases where an individual has gotten to know of a genetic disorder , disclosing or otherwise , to his or her relative is solely a matter of preference within the indivdial moral system
the issue on right to know or not to know is highly debatable although it is a genetic risk , one can not be entire sure because the genetic information could possibly result from the families of either his maternal and paternal uncles , aunts or cousin
this also means that as soon as a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile , he or she concurently has a knowledge about others
this knowledge maybe relavant to them , and vice versa
an example that may serve as an illustration is breast cancer
it is hereditary
do one who suffered from this disease keep it a secret from their relatives ?
in retrospect , it is also ones duty to ensure that he or she undergo periodic healthchecks in their own own .
sometimes some family structure and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication
Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered from : the son or daughter for example , the parents who knows about this would decide who gets told and whom takes precedence in being ' allowed ' to tell
for example , within a family , regardless of who had first received genetic information , parents were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on information to any offspring , either adult at risk or at risk
in addition , a woman testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself , although this may be further complicated by an individual 's response to risk information as they not want to know
hence , there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know ( such as nieces and nephews ) nor persuade those with authority ( the parents ) to do so
the notion of authority also extended'vertically ' .
for example , a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt , even when she is not at genetic risk herself while the aunt is
From a practitioner 's perspective these findings are important because if lay constructs of the family and kinship are a social construct they may not be in line with geneticists ' views of family relationships , or about which blood ( or non-blood ) relatives should be informed and by whom ; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context .
Ultimately , one must bring attention to who may benefit from such information and assisting those at risk to make considered decisions about disclosure
whose duty it is to inform at risk relatives or not greatly depends on the personal moral and the nature of how ' directive ' the risk is to them
people with close blood relationship generally carry some similar genes
In this case , if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry genetic risk , it is better for the patient to tell his / her close relatives about the issue and let others known about the risk so that his / her familay members are able to perform some daily excesses to prevent the potential disease or they may go to hospital and check for the correspongding flows .
in my opinion , although the annouance of carrying a genetic risk involves the issue of self privacy , it is necessary for the carrier to be obligated to tell the issue to his or her relatives in order for them to prevent the potential disease
I agree with this statement to a large extent
Focus on the negative side of the annouance of genetic risk first
Large numbers of patients with genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance of carrying certain disease
especially for young people without marrige , if he / she is known to have some genetic risk , it may have certain chance that his / her child would carry the same disease , but not in certain
Therefore , keeping the information as secret to his / her future spouce would help the relationship
Secondly , annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue , although the factor would not be that serious , people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go to hospital and do additional check or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease , and this creats unnecessary costs to the family .
Furthermore , the annouance of genetic risk would affect the relationship with relatives as sometimes others may think not to stay too close to the carrier so that they have less chance to get the potential disease
on the other hand , if the genetic risk is kept as a secret , although it may benefit the carrier to a certain extend and help to keep privacy , but it has much larger negative impacts to the family members and relatives
first , for the case of marrige , people should be honest and tell his / her spouce they may carry certain genetic risk that may affect their offsprings
it is better to let the other party know the fact than after the baby is born and certain type of genetic disease is found
it is better for both parties to be honest
Secondly , genetic disease has a close relationship with the born gene together with their daily habits
for example , if a carrier is told that he / she has the risk to have diabetes
In this case , the carrier can eat less candies and chocolates to prevent intake to much sugars , and at the same time , if the carrier tell this information to the relatives , it will be useful for them to know that they may have diabetes in the future becouse of related genes and they can perform the same exercise to intake less sugar to prevent the disease .
Otherwise , if the other parties did not know , they may end up with to have diabete in the future without any prevention
in conclusion , we could tell the benefits of telling genetic risk to the carriers relatives overweights the costs
Therefore , it would be better for the carrier to be obligated to tell the information to the relatives , in order to let them know and prevent the potential disease through daily exercises
among all kinds of different diseases , a large amount of different kinds of disorders are caused by genetic reasons
Genetic disorder may or may not be hirataged hereditary disease and it is sometimes hard to find out one has these kinds of diseases
it is a long time discussion that whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives that he or her disease is caused by gene
from the legal aspect , the answer is no but from the ethical aspect , it should be yes
we ca n't make a law to push a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his genetic problem
it is immoral and impractical
Firstly , someone having what kinds of disease belongs to his or her privacy
privicy protection belongs to one 's human rights
if a law requires someone to tell others ' privacy especially when the one is not willing to do so
it is againt against his or her human rights and it is against the law 's spirit
the law 's spirit also include fairness
what is the basic difference between genetic disorder and other disorders
it is unfair to release a law only point to the genetic disorder
in addition , it is impractical to make such a law
a good law should be clear and easy to execute
however , there are many problems againt the execution of asking a carrier to tell his or her ralatives the cause of the diseases
Firstly , what is the range of the relatives ?
for example , does the carrier only need to tell his or her direct relatives like parents and brothers and sisters or does he also need to also tell relatives like his grandmother 's sister 's son 's daughter 's nephew ?
if you say only need to tell direct relatives , it will be against the fairness of law
other relatives may have the same possibilities to have such kind of disease
how can a law made by government exempt such a group of people from preparing to face their potetial disease ?
however , from the ethical point of view
to the carrier himself of herself , he of she should have a feeling of resposiblity to tell his or her relatives their genetic disorder
by doing this , they may be able to save some lives of their relatives
it is because a carrier with bad gene may not necessary have those genetic disease , if they can have coresponding healthy lifestyle before the age that the gene 's function become stronger
a typical example is genetic caused hypertension
Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems which make the carrier harder to digest the fat and salt in blood which can cause hypertension
people usually get this kind of hypertesion after they become adult
however , if they already know they have a gene that may make them have higher possibilities to get hypertention
they can build a daily habit to eat less salt and fat and thus to avoid hypertension
in a nutshell , our society ca n't push genetic problem carrier to tell his or her disease to his / her relatives but he or she should be willing to tell their or her relatives about his/ her genetic problem
by doing so , less of his or her beloved ones will suffer from the genetic problem
in the age of rapid technological advancement , a lot of medical breakthroughs are made possible
Genetic testing is made possible and available for one 's decision to undergo .
it is able to detect the illnesses or diseases and even a child 's parentage
However , it will become a controversial issue as it becomes a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his or her relatives
if the knowledge of genetic risk was to be shared within the family or relatives , there might have chances for them to have it in their blood , which they may do necessary precautions to prevent
but , if it is a terminal disease as a genetic disease , most of the relatives will be disheartened upon having the knowledge about it
Therefore , some carriers will have the opinion of keeping it as a secret .
this essay will discuss whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not
some said that the genetic risk that is found in a person should not be kept secret because it is considered as a personal information which should be kept confidential
most patients will be depressed after realising his or her conditions
if one has a genetic disease after the test , he or she might not wish to inform the relatives as he might ended up dishearten his extended family
some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring in any pessimism into their family
Furthermore , some will wish not to become a burden of anyone as seeking medical attention is relatively costly
Hence , some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidential
on the other hand , some may think that it will be considerate to tell the relatives because the latter will have a higher tendency of getting the same genetic risk
hence , they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or to do some measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease
Nevertheless , it will depend on what kind of genetic diseases are given in the context of current medical technology
for example , breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is being realised in the early stage
hence , with the knowledge of having genetic risk , the relatives of this genetic disease will do a medical check-up , which might save them in realising it at a earlier stage
in conclusion , it will be considerate to inform the risk of getting the same genetic disease to the relatives
Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention , such as financial issue , everyone should be given the rights of knowing their family 's inherent medical conditions
however , some think that it might be better for those who are ignorant about it and will continue leading a happy life
in addition , some may think that even knowing about having genetic risk of the disease , it will just adding on to their misery as there is nothing that they can do about it
all-in-all , it depends on individual and also the nature of the disease , but he or she should be obligated to inform the relatives if there are possibilities in curing or preventing it
Genectic testing is a personal decision , with the kowledge that there is a possiblity that one could be a carrier or not
those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing , even if there is no risk at all
Early pre-examination is healthy as it will cast away unwanted doubts and affect the psychological thoughts of those affected
for a genetic risk carrier , there should be choice given with regards to informing his / her relatives
there should not be forced or obligied to do so , as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier
with regard to this choice given , there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of decision making
if the genetic risk carrier is a minor or a child , then most likely the decision of informing the relative should be made with the consideration of the patients parents or legal guardian
such patients are still emotionally volatile or they may be unaware of the consequences of such genetic disorder due to their young age
Furthermore the act of informing others without consent from their parents or the patients itself could harm the psychological state of the affected family
Thus , much thought need to be put on the immediate family as it could caused a stir of unwanted events from the patient or the family members itself
some family may feel hurt , with regards to their family pride or reputation , on having knowledge of such genetic disorder running in their family
however , there is a role and a sense of responsibility to inform their relatives since it is a genetic disorder
there might be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and any other families within the same family tree
the importance of informing relatives of such genetic disease is vital as it may help to raise awareness and prevention towards the genetic disorder
also , this known information will help their relatives to make informed decisions and tosimilarly undergo genetic testingto find out about the outcome
thus , having the knowledge that such genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotinal thoughts
and if the results turn out to be otherwise , then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically for the future outcome and aid them in making upcoming decisions
in addition , the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it is been made known to them
having support from relatives are vital as they ensure the genetic risk carrier that he / she is not alone in facing this illness and it will certainly provide a morale boost as the whole family will share a common sentiment with regards to the future prospect of the genetic disorder which could be inherited by anyone in the family
the decision to inform relatives of such genetic disorder will be dependent on the situation and backgroung of the affected family , with liberty of choice given to them in making the decision of informing others
a person with a disorder , regardless of mental or physical disorder , is always easy to be awared by his or her families
when it comes to genetic issues , it is not that simple anymore
Genetic disorder inheritance is generation by generation , but not all of the offsprings show the relevant symptoms
sometimes a family with potential genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies as none of their members reflect any observable disorder symptoms
as a result , in case that when one of the members happen to feel uncomfortable or unnormal , he or she should aware of whether the disorder in his or her body is a genetic risk or not
afterward , the carrier will face a serious ethical issue , which is whether to reveal the problem to his or her relatives or not
if the disorder symptoms reflect on a kid , the parent will be informed by medics for sure , then the whole family will stay alert to their bodies ' condition
on contrary , if the carrier is an adult , who has his own choice to choose whether to inform his or her relatives about the risk , that will be more complex .
one may think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves his or her family more than himself , there is no doubt that he or she will tell his / her family about the issue
that is true and of course it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of the family .
Think of the other way , if a child of the family knows that he has the risk to become a genetic risk carrier , and the risk might as well inherit to his child in the future , his whole life will be in a dilenma
and of course , he or she will think of not having any child after getting married , and the same thought goes to the cousins as well
as a result , the family generation stops by the moment the adult carrier announces his issue
in China , the older generation with traditional culture background , will always think of having more children as well as grandchildren , to make the family liven up and stronger
the reason behind is that after WOWII the population of China decreased dramatically and so the government encourage the people to give more birth .
during that period , if one of the family member reflects genetic disorder symptoms , he will fell in an ethical dilenma for sure
the medical treatment technology during that time is not advanced enough to completely cure him
he has to choose whether to protect his family or make his family more prosperous with a potential generic risk
and so , he would have chosen not to undergo generic disorder testing and let the truth be mined forever
this kind of ethical issue can not be judged by the others because they will not understand the position and duty of the carrier in the family
in conclude , people should think carefully of what is the consequences of telling relatives about his or her generic disorder issue
it is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives , but also an obligation to a family member to liven up the family
Regardlessly , if the disorder is rarely to be fatal , or it does not cause any inconvenience to the carrier , revealing the truth is always the right thing to do
in my opinion , the carrier should tell his or her relatives about it
one of the reasons why is because as a carrier , she or he needs a mental support to go through with this situation
it will be hard for an individual to deal with the issue on its own
By telling to his or her family other than being a support , they could possibly help her to get alternative solutions to the problem that she is facing right now
Other than that , I believe that the stong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support to the carrier
Furthermore , as it is a genetic problem , it will be better for the carrier to inform his or her family as other family member might experience the same thing
By making sure that they are aware of this genetic problem , they could have a full check-up for themselves and it will be better if they could even prevent it from happening to themselves
I find that it is important to inform especially if it is contagious , the carrier could prevent the disease from spreading out to society
for every action there are always pros and cons
I believe that some of the carriers will choose to not reveal their disease to the family members as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even feel ostracized by them
Furthermore , as it could incur spending a lot of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be the burden in her family
I could understand the feeling of the carrier .
she or he does not want to be the source of unhappiness in thefamily .
however , we will never know whether this negative effects will happen when the carrier decide to tell his or her family of the his / her condition
in conclusion , personally I feel that it is better for the carrier to inform her family members about the issue
the carrier should be honest with his or her feeling and I find that it is the right of the family member to know what is going on to his / her life
if anything wrong happened to the carrier 's life , without informing the family members it could make a huge regret in their life if she leaves without them knowing about it
on top of that , it is better to think about solutions for her problem with the family members as there are more heads to think on it rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on your own
in the end , I believe that the support in terms of mental or even monetary support from your family could help the carrier to fight against the genetic disease
True enough that there are lots of cancer 's patient who were given second choice to live as a normal person as they have strong mental support from their loved one
in my opinion , as long as we keep our mind healthy and strong , we can fight any disease as they come to us when we are fragile and weak .
as the techonology has been advancing , it has reached a stage whereby the advancement triggers some ethical dilemmas in relation to the acutual use of the technologyonology
genetic testing has been made possible- it has become easy to tell if one is a carrier of a known genetic risk through genetic testing
if used for a good purpose , it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness , however , it could also make situation worse by revealing who the carrier is , in the family
the question given is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives and I think that the carrier should not be compelled to do so because I belive that he or she has right not to know
Firstly , genetic testing is not something that is compulsory .
of course , some people may do it to make their futures slightly happier , however , the carrier , before the testing , can choose not to go for the test and simply live with unknowns and accept the facts
if he chooses to live in the uncertainty that the gene holds and willing to accept it , he could do that , and it has been something that is ' normal ' to everyone in the past as gentic testing was not possible
it could rather be better for him or her this way .
some people might say that it is a form of prevention of giving birth to disabled lives and making them suffer in real-life
I personally think this ist he right purpose of going through genetic testing , so that a family who can not afford to have a disabled kid do not have to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer
however , I belive that the carrier has right not to obligate to tell anyone but has responsibility to take an action to prevent any ethical dilemma
if the result turned out something that the carrier can not accept then it would have been better not knowing the truth
I belive that even the carrier has the right not to know the true fact
after realizing the he or she is tshe carrier , the emotional damage would be hard to bear
it could possibly cause a problem in a family due to the fact and creates more unhappiness int the family
Overall , I belive that it entirely depends on the carrier to share the hard facts and face it with relatives but he has no obligation to tell still .
in fact , I strongly think that the carrier should weigh both the positive and negative consequences of taking the genetic testing and tak an appropriate action to the results
the emotional depression that the carrier might get and the sense of guilty can be more than expected and could be a burden in mind for the rest of the life
on the other hand , without knowing any genetic disorder and accepting the fact , the family will stay positive and work together to overcome diability
I think the family will stay mentally healty as it is , without having emtional stress
debates have been around for years , that should a carrier for a known genetic risk be obligated to inform his or her relatives
any individual at risk for a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing , but whether the results should be informed to others , especially close family or relatives , is a topic worth discussing
this is an issue need to be addressed as family-related ethical dilemma is involved
in this essay , few arguments will be pointed out in support of view for any carrier of that known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives
when we were born , we were surrounded by our family and relatives , with them welcoming us to this new world
we were crying hard but we are not alone , it 's our family and relatives that grow us up
hence , they should be the people to be grateful for and the people we would like to share the joy with
however , in the case pertaining to any health issue or to the extent of serious disorder , it may seems no point of sharing but this involves more than just sharing bad news
one definitely has the right to disclose his or her health issues to anyone , but it 's also one 's responsibility to inform the family and close relatives
as the case of health issue is related to genetic risk , with keyword on " genetic " which highlights the risk of passing down the disorder to the next generation
Therefore , I would agree to that it 's obligated for a carrier of known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives to avoid any family-related ethical dilemma that could be raised up in the future
despite one may argue that it 's still up to the individual to disclose such health issue or to bear it within him / herself , it 's certainly helpful to share with close relatives , for a proper discussion for solutions
By doing so , one will feel less stressful in facing such disorder risk
Relatives will certainly be supportive and show more caring towards the carrier of a known genetic risk
by informing them , the carrier is never alone in fighting the battle of such disorder risk
on top of that , as the genetic risk may pass down to next generation , thus it will involve more than just one family
it is therefore I would agree for the obligation of telling the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and have a plan for giving birth
this would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemma
there are more intangible advantages that could support the stand of informing the relatives once the results are known after the test conducted
in conclusion , in order to avoid the family-related ethical dilemma , it is best for any carrier of known genetic risk to inform his / her relatives
the benefits of doing so are able to outweigh its disadvantages
more supports must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing of such junction whether should him / her to inform the relatives
the decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder
this is the common law in the society
this leads to a new problem that " should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
" this issue has been discussed for a long time
however , there is still a diversity of point of view among the people
Thus , we are going to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the issue which is " should or should not " .
Firstly , I believe most of us will agree with the sentences below : " I will be anxious about my families when he or she told me that he / she was a carrier of a known genetic risk " .
frequently , the intention of carriers does not want to tell their families that they are to continue their own life without the anxious of families
it is obvious that there will be better for one person to be worried than many .
however , many of the carriers are not strong enough to overcome the challenges oneself
with the families ' support , there must be more energy to fight against with the demon
demon is not easily defeated and it requires much of energy and psychological support
families give you the courage and support which you can not retrieve by yourself
that is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges
Besides that , the risk of the known genetic is very serious that it can not be described
the seriousness can be larger than our imagination
Lying on the bed for the remaining life , and even dying immediately , these are the consequences which we can not imagine .
families are our dearest in our life
without their concern and support , we are hard to stay until this time
they play an important role in our life which can not be substituted
a known genetic risk can also affect our next generation critically
Therefore , it is our responsibility to tell the relatives to prevent undesired consequences
Generally , the clinic or hospital will not tell the carrier 's families without the agreement of carrier
it is the ethic of staff in hospital to keep the secret of any patients .
we can not blame them that they are liable to undesired consequences
however , hospital can provide a councilor to advice the carrier about the action can be taken
Therefore , this kind of circumstances will not be happened again and again .
it is a method that benefits two parties which is a win-win situation
in conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk is encouraged to tell his or her relatives about the known risk .
however , there may be some special case that is hard to be defined
Thus , advice from hospital plays the important role for this .
Carrier is responsible to balance his or her own interest and the benefits of family and even society
it is a hard decision to make but with the most appropriate way , it will create great circumstances for the carrier and families in the future
with the risk of being genetically disorder , many individuals have done the decision to undergo genetic testing
with the nature that the results will be known once the tests are done , each individual that is diagnosed to be a genetic risk carrier face an ethical problem : they should warn their relatives about the risk of being the same genetic risk carriers
or they can choose to keep silent until the next carrier is diagnosed
in view of my point , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives , with the support of the following reasons
first of all , from the angle of human right , a genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell the truth to others
this diagnosis can be regarded as a kind of privacy to carriers
they may do not want this truth to influence their life or want to keep it as a secret and do not others know about it
this is reasonable since exposure of the truth of being a carrier may make them be discriminated or sympothized by others which is not positive factors brought to their life
seconly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to do genetic testing regardless of the dignosis of the carriers
when people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers , they can go and approach a doctor to consult about it
if they do not want to think too much about it and view it as a trouble , they may just ignore the possibility
however , if a dignosed carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives , the relatives will be forced to know their higher chance of being genetic risk carriers
this obeys their own willingness as in they have to accept the truth which may make their following life miserable
many people argue that setting the obligation may help more people , who are the relatives of carriers , save their lives with a larger opportunity because of early diagnosis
this is not exactly true when other factors including psychological influence , social influence , are taken into consideration
if one such relative is told that he or she may have higher risk of getting sick , he or he may have been scared about the unknown life , partners , spouse and colleagues may choose to leave , and many other situations may happen which means the relative 's life may be ruined
on the other side , as stated above , a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually
in a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk should have their own right to decide whether to tell their relatives or not
this should be accepted from the point of human right , freedom of acceptance of relatives as well as many other social reasons
Otherwise , making it an obligation will restricate the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives
for a carrier of genetic disorder to know the fact that he or she is a carrier , it causes more dilemma rather than getting the disorder
I agree that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives
there are four reasons why people do n't have to be shy and share their problems regarding genetic disorder
Firstly , the carrier and his or her family can take precautions , physically by actions to reduce the chance of it being inherited to offspring and , mentally , if the action fails to prevent it from being inherited
many syndromes such as Down Syndrome and Taylor Syndrome can be prevented to happen if the mother undergoes proper medication and do n't consume harmful goods during pregnancy period
this information may not be known by the mother if she does n't tell her relatives regarding her condition
more people ( relatives ) know her problem , more information channel is provided
if all efforts have been made but the children still suffer from the syndrome then the family have to accept this fact and do whatever they can to bring a good environment for their children 's growth
this is not the parent 's fault because there are still chances of the gene being inherited
so , they have to also prepare mentally mentally
Secondly , genetic diseases costs highly for treatment and medication
albinism is one of the examples
the people with albinism have sensitive skin and it needs regular treatment
Unlike people with high proportion of skin pigment , people with albinism is prone to sunburn and other skin diseases
if they do n't treat their body well , such as by using sunglasses or wearing sunscreen in outdoor , the chances are good that they will get skin problems that may also lead to cancer
once you suffer from cancer , the medication cost is very expensive
to prevent the bigger problem from happening , it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body
if the carrier does n't tell his or her relatives , it may be too late to get their support and prepare financially
thirdly , some diseases are not noticeable and may lead to serious health problems
one of the diseases is sickle cell trait .
Usually people are not aware if they carry the sickle cell gene and this may lead to circulatory problem such as blood blocking
if the parents know that one of them is a carrier and disclose the information to their relatives then they can bring their children to undergo genetic testing and do n't need to be shy of it because it is for the sake of their children 's health
fourthly , it is important for parents to give mental boost for their children with genetic disorder
when their children become teenagers , a lot of social problems may arise
people and friends often mock your conditions
a strong mental condition and conviction must be build from within and from the closest ones
if not their family then who else are willing to do that ?
it is not a heavy job for the family if they have prepare their mental first by disclosing information of the probability that their children may suffer from the genetic disorder
in this modern world , the technologies were improved a lot compared with the last century
particularly , in the medical field , there is a great improvement in many treatments for many formally incurable diseases , and genetic testing is one of the methods which were used to diagnose an individual at risk for a genetic disorder
the medical authorities claimed that only the individual who is at risk for a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing
however , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a family-related ethical dilemma is born
the question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives
in my opinion , the carrier of a known genetic risk has to tell his or her relatives about this .
this is because his or her relatives have the right to know about this .
as many people realize , a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives , that is , one of the family members is at risk for a gene disorder means that other family members also have almost the equally risk to have it , so this problem should be treated seriously by the family
every family member has their human right to know what is going on with them
if they do not even know that they are at risk for a genetic disorder , how can this explain their right ?
for instance , John is informed by his doctor that he is at risk for a genetic disorder but he does not tell his sibling , James about this
Although telling James about this is horrible to some extent , he should know what will be likely to be going on for him
this might be beneficial for his future if he is aware of the risk of having this disorder
the next point is that telling relatives can raise their awareness of having the similar genetic disorder , preventing certain genetic disorders to affect themselves
Genetic disorders are innate , but the great improvement of medical treatment makes it possible for humans to prevent the disorder or to reduce the negative effects of the disorder on themselves
in addition , doctors usually quote a statement , " Prevention is better than curation " ; this gives us an idea that preventing a disorder to happen has far more advantages than curing it
awareness of having genetic disorder may help in diagnosing a genetic disorder for a person , and therefore , this may make the prevention of a certain disorder possible
for example , hypertension is partially due to genetic factors , but environmental factors also play an important role
People who aware of having such disorder can prevent the disorder from happening by adapting a healthy lifestyle , including having a balanced diet and at least having exercise for 30 minutes every day
to sum up , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives
this is their human right to know about that , and this may also save their lives by preventing the disorder from happening
Together with the advancement of technology over past decades , medical advancement has increased exponentially and further enhancements are still constantly upgrading . Empower doctors with advance medical knowledge , doctors are able to diagnose and undergo genetic testing for patients to help them prevent and take necessary steps to protect their life . However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a question of disclosing the results to his or her relatives become a challenging issue to both patient and doctor . In my opinion , I feel the strong urge to support the obligation to inform patient relatives .
As it is a genetic risk , the patient next-of-skin might have a high chance of carrying the risk , hence the need to inform their relatives is important so that necessary prevention actions could be taken before unforeseen circumstances might occur . For example , if you are the only child in a family and unfortunately , you are suffering from a genetic disease that the genetic trait might be passed on to your next generation if you have a child , hence by letting your family members aware of the situation , it would lessen family stresses and suffering on forcing you to settle down and have children . However , social ethic issues like discrimination and privacy are biggest concerns and potential barriers to enforce patients or doctors to disclose information to patients relatives . It challenges the confidentiality and privacy principles . Currently , under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) in the United States , there is no legal obligation requirement to disclose information to relatives , it is up to the patient 's wish to disclose to their family members . Early disclosement to family members brings in positive reaction and prevention , as in the case of Angelina Jolie , she chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent . I still can recall her reason for disclosing her own story was that she does not want to live under the shadow of cancer .
However , there are still people against the decision of revealing private information . As in the case of Alzheimer patients , it is up to the patient 's own choice to disclose information . However , research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret who , how and whom will Alzheimer disease be disclosed to minimise potential negative impact to families members ( DementiaToday,2012).There are associations provide helps to Alzheimer patients like Alzheimer 's Association ( Alzheimer 's Association,1980).Although there are still thousand of genetic risk diseases out there that might not be receiving all helps and supports from everyone , the needs to receive immediate understanding and support from family members is an utmost help that patients need in their difficult time .
In conclusion , the state should have passed a legal bill to measure and provide information to doctors that till which extend should a doctor opt to reveal to relatives members about the genetic disease and in which situations it is open to patient 's decision . In addition , the state could also encourage to create assistance schemes to aid necessary help to needy patients to encourage them to open up for the benefit of own and family members . Although it may face challenges from social ethic issues , in a long term , with appropriate encouragement and aid from the government , more individuals would have a different view of acceptance and take appropriate measurements to protect their own health and their loved ones .
nowadays , the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to the high-velocity technological advancement
not long ago , the human genome project sponsored by several large multinational corporations ( MNCs ) has been started
in comparison , in the field of genetic testing which enables people to be aware of the risk of a possible genetic disorder , as the technology has been very mature already , an even more popular topic arises .
while most people agree that each individual has his own right to decide whether to undergo a genetic test or not , they have different stands in whether it is the patient 's responsibility or freedom to share the result with his or her relatives
in my opinion , the patients , which are carriers of some known genetic risk are supposed to share the truth with their family members
Admittedly , it is a social obligation to be responsible for the life of other people
to the whole society , it is a duty .
take H1N1 as an example , all the people in Singapore including students at school , travelers at Changi Airport , workers in the office as well as passengers on the street are forced by law to take their temperature and report the result to the relevant government authority in charge
to those family members who care about them , it is also a moral obligation .
how can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get them in danger ?
the basis of a family is that everyone trusts and loves each other with no doubts
without trust and love , there is no difference between a family and a bunch of strangers living together
hence , it is essential to tell their family members about their genetic disorder both as a social responsibility and a favor to conserve the family basis
Moreover , telling their family members the truth is the fastest and easiest way to get their support
without the support of loved ones , patients ' life is no better than death
Family members , as one of the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort , is a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder
a study of New York University in 2010 shown that patients with family members around generally recovers 2 - 4 days faster than those taken care by professional nurses
even for those with terminal diseases , the duration of their survival is 30 % longer due to the family support
some people may say that telling the truth may arise some unnecessary doubts and panics which will endanger the family harmony
while every family need to go through this or that kind of troublesome situations , the more troubles that a family has gone through together , the greater bond will be established between the family members as well as the greater amount of trust , love and understanding
hence , for a family in which every member is truly believing in each other and loving each other , all these troubles are just testaments to make them stronger .
just as the lyrics of Kelly Clarkson , what does n't kill you make you stronger
being in Asian society where genetic testing is not a common practice , I do think that it is the choice of the patient whether he or she wants to tell his or her relatives about his / her disease
the courage to take the genetic testing and yet to inform their relatives about the risk that they may have may result in people being judgmental while actually it is just a risk and not a confirmed case
Furthermore , since it is the person 's gene that is affected , he has the right to determine with whom he wants to share the information with
Nevertheless , while I fell that a carrier should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives about the genetic risk , I would like to suggest the person to at least share the information with her or his potential partner ( husband or wife ) since the individual 's genetic risk may affect their future children
many people in our society are not well informed about many genetic diseases and many of them will most likely judge or at least differentiate those who have genetic diseases since they feel that the patients are abnormal or ' weird ' .
this is because many relate genetic diseases to those such as Bubble-Boy disease , autism or down-syndrome
in those diseases , many who are affected do actually have different physical characteristics compared to those without the genetic diseases
while we do know that we should not discriminate them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without them realizing it
in this particular case , we are discussing about whether a person should tell his relatives about having a RISK of a particular genetic disease
It is normal for people to demand for a fair and similar treatment as the others and therefore it is normal for people to try to keep some of their secrets or personal issues to themselves in case some people judge them or treat them differently . Many people really love to hear what they want to hear and therefore they may just ignore the word ' risk ' and assume that the person has suffered from the disease .
to prevent that from happening , I do feel that it is up to the person whether he wants to share the information with his family since his family may either be paranoid or judge him and act differently
especially when it is just a risk , the option is really his since he is not an actual sufferer
there may be some people who say that it is necessary to tell the family members about the risk since some of them may be affected , while I do think that this view has a point , how much you can trust your family regarding this issue may also be a case
may be we can trust our immediate family members but can we trust all the other relatives ?
Furthermore , since genetic risk or genetic disease is a very personal case , it is up to the person 's call to tell the relatives about it
however , as I said earlier , it is better for the person to at least tell about the potential risk to his or her future partner since his genetic risk may affect his children later
this information needs to be at least acknowledged by the other party before they make the decision to get married and have children
there may be possibilities when both the husband and wife are carriers and therefore they should not have any child since their child may not be able to survive even after they are born
or in a less extreme case , the child may be disabled
this piece of information does play a role in family planning matters , therefore although no one is obliged to tell about their genetic risk to anyone , it should be encouraged to tell it to their future partner
in conclusion , whether or not the carrier wants to tell his relatives regarding his genetic risk , the choice is his because it is his own gene and he has the full right of it
he may have different considerations other than due to judging people or may result in making his family worry for nothing when thinking of whether he should tell it to his relatives , and no matter what choice he makes , we need to respect it and we have no right in saying that he must tell his relatives about it
we all know that life is priceless and we have no right to judge a person 's death
with the improvements of technology , a new life with genetic risk can be detected
Genetic refers the chance of inheriting a disorder or disease
Therefore an entirely new dilemma is born : should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
this essay will discuss the reasons why the relatives are obligated to be informed that their children have genetic risk
one of the reasons that the parents should be informed is that they have to decide whether they are capable to raise a child with genetic risk
the child with genetic risk may not have the ability to work , to build up the family with the others and most of the time they are not acceptable for the majority
they may not be able to enjoy a normal people can enjoy .
this competitive world is cruel to those who are not able to survive .
parents and relatives have to work longer than expected and endlessly to foster their child if he / she is not able to foster himself / herself
the situation may become worst if the child has diseases like cancer or heart disease , which means that parents have another heavy baggage named medication fees
not only the child but also the entire family will suffer
it is still early for parents to decide whether they can foster a new life that are not able to work and may suffer the pain in the entire life
the other reason that parents should know the baby they have is a carrier of genetic risk is for a nation 's good
there are always newspaper report that a new born baby has be abandoned at hospital after they realized the baby have diseases that need a huge amount of money to secure
for the countries like Singapore , they are short of manpower to contribute to the nation
however , every year the government has to spend a lot to help disables such as medical subsidizes and builds up special schools to educate them
without increasing number of disables in a nation , the government is able to concentrate to develop in other ways like military and education
as citizens of a nation , they have the responsibility to support their country in many ways
Moreover , in the world we are living today , many miscarriages are conducted in hospital every day
it is easier for people to accept it morally
Therefore I believe parents have their right to know the healthiness of their child
many people may support with a theory that every people have their right to enjoy the world , especially people with religions
however , the problem is , will the people really enjoy their life if they have to stay at hospital everyday and with all the needles and endless pain ?
Parents know what the best is for their children , thus they will make a right decision after they have be informed
also , human being should improve the medical field in order to prevent the tragedy happen
I think a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives
Genetic testing is a personal choice
one should have full control of his / her information and it is his / his right to decide whether or not to disclose it to some one else .
as far as I am concerned , when a couple are planning to have babies , they are going to run a few tests and see whether their could have some genetic diseases
the results are disclosed to husbands and wifes
this is not the case I am talking about here
the most obvious reason for those who argue for this opinion is that the relatives of the carrier are at high risk of carrying these diseases
they have the right to know whether they are at risk
also , telling them the result can let them largely reduce the cost for multiple testing
they can also take immediate measures to reduce the possibility of having this disease
if person has a disease C that might be a result of gene A.
he runs a test and know that he has the gene AA .
this means both of his parents has gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of runing two separate tests to see whether they are under high disease risk or not.if he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa
this means one of his parents has gene A and one cost of testing could be saved
his relatives can then take measures , if this disease can some how be prevented , to stop this disease from taking their lives
this can also be achieved from personal choice
one can choose to tell their relatives if they are at risk
most people care about their relatives , if there is no serious consequence of telling them so , I assume most of them will tell their relatives to be careful .
one might also choose to hint or encourage their certain relatives to run a gene test if they are concerned about negative consequences that comes across when they disclose their genetic results
there are possible negative consequences that those might face if they disclose their genetic results to their relative
if a person is obliged to tell his / her relatives , he or she might be discriminated by those who do not carry this gene
he or she might even be adviced not to get married or have children .
for example , if an unmarried person has gene Aa and gene aa is sufficient for a very seriou disease
after he takes the test and be obliged to tell his relatives , everyone know that he is a carrier
so all the married couples go run a test and know they are not carriers . They might subconsiously see him as different and worry that he will find a wife who will carry this gene as well .
third , it is hard to define relatives .
if a gene runs in the family , one of the family member test positive , whom does he need to tell ?
if that is a big family , is he obliged to tell everyone ?
spouses usually have very close relationships , if person A tell his family that he has this gene , his uncle C knows and tells his wife D that he needed to run a test because his cousine has this disease
however wife D is not even under the risk of having this disease
then wife D might tell her mother , who likes to gossip on her way to the theatre .
in less than a week half of the town knows person A has a risked gene , and his family might be a genetically risked family
then nobody wants to marry A , or his relatives .
this is the potential consequence if one does not have full control of his / her information , especially when the party that he is obliged to disclose his information to is a potentially large group ( relatives ) .
in conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives
Carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives
nowadays , people not only pursuit the comfort of their own life but also a better development of their following generations
since the technology of modern society has been so advanced , it becomes possible for people to make decision to take genetic test so as to be clear whether or not they carry genetic risk which can affect their next generation
the debatable question , an ethical dilemma , is that are people responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk ?
in my opinion , the responsibility of telling family and relatives is quite obvious .
and there are two basic reasons
the first one is the importance of being responsible for your self-wellness and health of your relatives and the second one is responsible for the next generations .
the awareness of relatives and families about your genetic risk is good for your self-wellness and health of your relatives
because if you are carrying that genetic risk , then there is great possibility that your relatives like parents or siblings are carrying the same genetic risk as well
the genetic risk that you carry may or may not affect your health and put you in danger
if you have n't undergone the genetic testing , it 's just odd and fate for what will happen to both you and your relatives
however , if you have undergone and known that you are a carrier , you are responsible for your whole family
even though you can not eliminate the risk completely , you can at least try to be alert to avoiding getting the disease
as for those in your family who are more likely to be affected , they can go to the hospital to do the checks regularly
Therefore , telling the families and the relatives to get prepared for fighting the disease and even prevent to get the disease is your responsibility
Furthermore , you are also being responsible for your next generations by telling the truth that you are a carrier of a genetic risk
if your wife is not aware of the truth and give birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well
being the parent , you are not responsible to you next generations , since you allow the genetic risk to be passed on by generation and generation and being aware of it
however , if you tell the truth to your wife and relatives , you offer a chance about whether to have child or not
and if you still decide to have the baby , since the technology has been developed so advanced , it might be possible in the future that once the application of altering gene is perfected and widely used , you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future
this is the responsibility of being a parent .
and in my opinion , this seems to be the main purpose of undergoing that genetic testing at the first place
as a conclusion , once you have undergone genetic testing and being aware of carrying some specific genetic risk , there are responsibilities to your relatives , yourself , and your following generations by telling your relatives and families the truth
to tell or not to tell
Consider a case , we decide to undergo genetic testing and have known the result of it
we found that we actually are the genetic risk carrier
then it becomes troublesome about whether we need to tell our relatives who may carry this genetic risk as well
there are really a lot of things we need to consider
every choice we have made may have a huge impact on their whole life
as a result , what should we do ?
Tell them or keep this secret until we die ?
many people feel that we should tell our relatives since we really care about their health status
for example , diabetes is a kind of genetic disease
once we found we were carrying this genetic risk , it is better for us to tell our family members because they may carry it as well
if we tell them , they may start paying more attention to their daily habits like eating less sugar contained food and keeping a good mood
and it is important for those young people
the earlier we tell them , a better habit they will arise and better for the rest of their lives
what 's more they may undergo genetic test as well to see whether they are carrying it or not which is also better for them
however , some people may argue that why we want to interfere with their lives ?
sometimes it becomes extremely hard for them to accept this news especially if they are going to know that they or their descendants may have a severe disease like blood disease which is untreatable
Imagine you are living like a normal person but suddenly one day your relative comes tells you that actually there are some possibilities that you may encounter some disease in the future , what kind of feeling are you going to have ?
it may affect our daily lives and we will think about it every day .
we become so anxious that we can not focus on everything .
at the same time , there will also be chances that the genetic test result is not correct which means they are actually wasting their lives worrying about this thing , so actually we are bringing trouble to them
Personally I feel that we still should take our responsibility to tell them the situation
since this will really affect their lives , what we should do is try to make it in a positive way
we can not let it go .
we should know that although we may affect their lives , we can still let them make correct choices in the future
it is only after we tell them will they start paying attention to their health .
they will consider whether to give a birth to a new baby because of this genetic problem and they will start finding ways to try to avoid their baby to carry this genetic risk as well
they always have a choice about whether to undergo the genetic test or not .
maybe after we tell them , they will go for it and know more about themselves .
I know it will have a huge impact on them , but we should know that they are our loved ones , we need to tell them and help them
a genetic risk carrier should be obliged to tell
Genetic testing will be conducted when the individual is at risk of some possible disease
once the test is done , whether the results should be open to his or her relatives has caused extensive controversy
some say it is a kind of invasion of privacy for the carrier and should be protected
he or she has the right not to tell anyone .
however , in my opinion , it is the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about the actual situation
this essay will illustrate in two aspects
first of all , it can be an alert for the family members of the patient and let them be aware of the possible disease that they may also have
as we all know , genetic risk carriers are likely to pass the genetics to their family members
once one person in the family is found to be carrying risky genetic , other members in his or her family may also have the risk of disease
some of the diseases may not show symptoms until the carrier is old enough
Therefore , telling the relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble in this way and save much time for proper treatment
Sometimes life may even be saved if they are told early and conduct timely treatment
so for consideration for other family members , the relatives should be informed
Secondly , it can avoid genetic disease passed to the next generation when they intend to have babies
they should let their spouse know about his or her situation before marriage
they need to ask for doctor 's advice before they plan to have a baby
some genetic gene will pass only to boys rather than girls , some are on the contrary
if the carrier refuses to tell the truth to his or her spouse , another life may have risk of inheriting the genetic disease
I noticed a real story on newspaper years ago
A couple in China have a son of 5 years old
their son unfortunately fell ill and he was diagnosed with a kind of genetic disease which is very serious
they were told that the wife 's family was carrying the polygenetic disorder and can pass only to boys rather than girls
Therefore their son was inherited the genetic disease
however , the wife actually had already known about the polygenetic disorder before the marriage and she did not tell her husband
the son was died after one year 's treatment and the couple got divorced later after that
if the wife had not hindered the truth and asked for doctor 's advice before they have baby , the tragic would not happen
in a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk has the responsibility to tell his or her relatives
on the one hand , it can tell members of the carrier 's family the possible disease they may have and can perform treatment in time if possible
on the other hand , it may pass the disease to the next generation if the carrier hides the truth
nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to do a genetic testing
we can not deny that the genetic testing really helps people a lot when they face the disorder problem
however , I thought that the genetic information is one person 's personal privacy which should be protected by law
Therefore , I thought a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
there are three reasons as follows :
Firstly , the information concerning to the genetic is something personally which is also a privacy like people 's bank card key
other people should not be told without the person 's permission even though they are his or her family or relatives
the government should set the law to protect this kind of privacy
once people 's genetic information is told to other people
they may know the person 's potential disabled disease or other bad things naturally
they may set a bias on this person even to abandon him or her
people do not have the ability to choose their gene , they should not be thought badly because of bad gene
so I think whatever the genetic is or whether the gene is match with their parents , it should not be told to anyone even his or her family or relatives
Secondly , the carrier of a known genetic risk may destroy the peace of a family even broken the relation between children with the adult
once his or her family or relatives know that the person does not have the relation with them
However happy they were before , there would be some barrier which will truly destroy the family gradually
the relationship between parents and their children should not be tested only in the genetic way ; it is something much deeper and tighter
the parents give knowledge and love to the children , meanwhile they feel happy with the accompany of the children
the children rely on the parent to live .
when they grow up , they take care of the old parents and thank them for their dedication
the relation between parents and children is something about love and dedication
everyone does not want to see the scene of broken family due to the carrier of a known genetic risk
Therefore , I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission .
Finally , the technology of testing the gene is not very mature now
there also exists some probability of wrong testing
if the wrong testing was not found by the doctor , the family and the children may be sad and have a struggling life for their whole life
Therefore I think a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives
Therefore , considering the people 's privacy and the existence of wrong testing , for the sake of the family , I support that a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person 's permission
a Carrier of a Known Genetic Risk Should be Obligated to Tell His or Her Relatives
more and more illness are discovered to be related to some genes with the development of the medical technology
people will know about whether they carry a disease on their genes after they have done the genetic test
if there is no problem , that will be wonderful .
however , not everybody is so lucky that they can make sure they do not carry any disease genes
Therefore , once people find they have carried the disease genes , they should be responsible to tell their relatives , at least their family members .
it may be awkward and embarrassed for a person to tell relatives that he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk
but if they are all from one family and have the same forefather , then of course they own the same genes in some part
Therefore there is nothing to be shy for or be afraid of .
if the person tell their relatives that he or she carries a disease gene , his or her relatives can go to hospital to check whether they also have a disease or not
then the relatives can prepare themselves to prevent the disease from occurring
also they can prevent the disease from going to their offspring
if the relatives carry that disease gene , they can share the experience with him or her and give some help to them , they will also teach them or her how to communicate with others about this issue
if he or her not get married , he or she must tell his or her partner that he carries disease gene .
then they can have a healthy baby with the help of the doctors
or else , if he holds back the genetic risk , they may have a unhealthy baby and may cause the death of the baby or end of their marriage
there is a story I watched on TV
a couple did not have a child after their marriage for a long time , their parents were anxious about that and asked them to go to hospital to check what was the problem
after came back from the hospital , the man told his parents that the problem was that he carried a disease gene so that they can not have a baby in their life time
the woman did not know the test result , but she overheard the talk and decided to divorce with her husband
after got the divorce certificate , the man showed her the test report ; it wrote that the woman carried the disease gene instead of the man
at that time , the woman known how much her husband loved her but she ruined her happiness
Tears showed nothing
people can not avoid carrying the disease genes , which they were born with
however , they can avoid the disease genes being inhered to their children
by telling their relatives that they may have a risk of carrying the disease gene , they can make their family members bond closely , also many risks and conflicts can be avoided
Genetic testing has become a beneficial way to predict and protect each individual at risk for a disorder
however , there rises a family-related ethical dilemma if it is right to tell a carrier 's family once the test has been conducted and the results are known
I am most inclined to believe that his or her relatives have the rights to know the result
the answer is simply that everyone , especially our family , has the right to know the truth .
though it is said that genetic testing involves emotional and social risks due to the test results , while the potential negative impacts of the risk still exist , the consequence will be significant if other members of his or her family do not know
then they are unable to have a suitable method to protect themselves and emotional preparations
Taking Angeline Jolie for example , she is famous but she still revealed the truth about her genetic testing on the development of breast cancer risk
everything is not that bad if you know how to look at the bright side with hope
people may feel angry , depressed , or even guilty about their results
in some cases , a carrier can suffer tension within a family because the result is also related to the others ' risk somehow
however , I believe it is just a usual reaction to this situation
in addition , though it can be possible in some cases that he or she and the family can undergo specific discrimination in employment and their social life , how people can face more dramatic tragedy such as sickness or death if they can not even overcome this harsh situation
Life is hard but people can not blame it on being unfair
it is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard time
Furthermore , living with a secret is not a good sensation , especially if the situations of other relatives become worse , you should feel guilty and depressed
Moreover , the truth can not be hidden forever but when it is revealed , more shocking and upset it will be .
as the result , it is in the interests of the carriers and their relatives , telling the genetic testing result is needed
last but not least , though genetic testing is a personal matter , telling the result to your family can improve and develop understanding and sympathy of each other as well as promoting awareness of taking care of everyone 's health
that plays an important role in the possibility that relatives can overcome the discrimination of society and anxiety about the risks
to put it in nutshell , I believe that people should have the obligation to tell their relatives about the genetic testing result for the good of their health
it can be very difficult for them but necessary for the carriers and their family
in addition , emotional preparations and the ways you explain your genetic condition is also important so that you can convey the correct information to your family and relatives and if necessary to guide them if he / she wish to conduct a similar genetic testing
the Impact Of Social Media
Social media has been playing a vital important role in our lives today
it is almost imposible for us to keep way from it
I started invoving into Facebook one years ago , when I just arrived singapore
and now I got over 500 friends on Facebook and buried myself with hundrends of seeds every day
we know each others ' status , changements and so on through the social media
for an example , if we change our contact numbers , we will not send SMS to each individual any longer
instead , we will post a seed and tag our friends to inform this kind of changments
and if you are not on it , you will just get lost .
in certain aspects , social media has brought us quite a lot of convenience .
it is becoming even more convinient than talking throught the phone since it is free
we discuss every thing we like and we have more personal space . Our friends also got more access to know what we are doing and what we like .
and also , we get a chance to talk to public people like popular stars and know their life better .
in China , a lot of government organizations have open blogs to communicate with people , like firefighters , police stations and so on
socia media allows them to explain to or inform people what is going on
and actually lots of rescuing jobs are done with the help of social media like looking for people lost and so on
with more convinient and humanian communications , the relationship between government and people gets largely improved
what 's more , various cultures can be shown to us through social medias
we can know more news and cultures through socia medias
from this scope , social media has shorten our distance
however , we get less chance and less importance to talk face to face since social media is so convinient , advanced and interesting
and even when we gather together more people find themselves has less topics to talk about than before and choose to dig from their social media again
when we are far away , social media makes it as we are infront of each other ; sometimes when we are by each others ' side , we are seem to be further than far away
this kind of feeling makes people 's relationship not as stable , secure and reliable as before
Besides , there are more people shwing their pictures of yummy food or travelling experience
to some extent , this makes our life more luxry and blundering
for myself , I am long to some places after seeing those beatiful pictures taken by my firneds
sometimes I even can sleep well because of excitement .
Social media makes our life patten so fast and left us less time to think about our life
Social media is becoming more important and we need to think more to make it serve us better and better
interpersonal skills , like any other skills requires practice
Besides that , these skills requires time to develop and adapted
the burgeoning of social media definitely has its stint ; but amongst all good things , it is better to have them in moderation
convenience and efficiency are two very important use of social media
while millions of users are connect at any one time , any information can be readily available at their perusal
this improves the connectivity between the users
for an example , one is able to send notifications and other information we use to have them in hardcopy previously , over the web and the process takes seconds
the receipent , will then receive the information almost immediately depending on the quality of the network
this covenience can be percieved almost in realtime
Next , communication are also greatly improved .
in the past , vast communication are done by one of the many such a telegram , snail mail and poor-quality voice calls
with the welcoming of application such as Skype and Facetime , any individual can phase off most , of the olden days communication methods
Aside from hearing the voice , a webcamera could also be affixed to emulate a'real ' interaction with expressions and gestures
Communication would have taken a different turn without the easily available social media
however , it is a good practice not to intesively use social media all the time
Intimate interaction greatly lack in social media interactions , particularly the touch .
having to meet and interact for talks allows one to be closer to the recepient
it involves a dynamic interaction which utlises the motor , thinking and verbal cortex of the mind to coordinate
Unlike the use of social media , most of interaction is done with thinking and typing
as a result , one does not train the necessarily parts of the skills required for a proper interpersonal relations
it is also entire incorrect to fault social media alone for the lack of interpersonal skill
Howard Garner studied the effect of multiple intelligences amongst people and stated that interpersonal intelligence is a form of skills on its own - some has it , some does not
Howard Garner mentioned that the different intelligences can be charted , in accordance with utilising tests , and ranked accordingly
Fundamentally , those who scored lower ranking for interpersonal skills are more likely to stumble when this skill is needed
though social media need not be necessarily bad , it must be used accordingly - for work , family , friends
the types of use must also be taken note of - informing , interacting , discussion and others
the space of separation between the parties must also be looked at
for people who are living very far from one another , intensive use of social media is justified
for those who live within the community , they should at least meet up , and not use social media as the primary source of communcation with each other
and at the same time , improves the interpersonal skill , through dynamic practises betwwen individuals and realtime presence
the inclusion of intimate presence and relative touch could also bring a better rapport between those interacting
Recently , the rise of social media helped people to have more closer connection with each other , it is a more convenient and cheaper way to have online contact compared with face to face meetings
in my opinion , social media websides such as Twitter and Facebook will not affect the chance for people to have face to face contact and thus negatively affects interpersonal skills
on the other hand , it may even increase the chance of having face to face contacts with amoung people
first , social media networks have a lot user base , it helps to link people from different parts of the world
in the days without the social networks , people may not have the chance to know others from different countries or the ones they never meet before
their number of people that they know may only limited to the people they meet in daily life like classmates and working partners
Therefore , social networks brings more and more connections between people and they may have a chance to chat with people they never knew before , and this helps to develop the interpersonal skills as well
Secondly , although social network takes time for people to chat online but not face to face , they may still decide a time online to meet others face-to-face in the daily life
in this case , the social network helps people to increase the frequency of talk
for example , if social network does not exist , business people need to meet each other face to face and it is other time consuming , even sometimes with business that is not so important , it still takes a lot time on travel which is a wastage
however , social network helps people to meet and chat much more easier , they can even use video chat and create group chat to chat with multiple parties at the same time
nowadays , even some companies conduct online video interview with their applicants as it saves time and cost
the social network may also creat some negative impacts for the people
the largest negative impact is that due to the online network , some people start to use and rely on internet every minute
they take too much time of using online social network and thus do not have time to have their daily meeting with people in their real life
it not only affect the interpersonal skills but also bad for people 's health if the ones spend too much time on social media
Secondly , social network may leak certain personal informations to the public , as the cyber environment is not perfect and not safe , people may not protect their privacy online effectively and sometimes , some people may use others personal information to deceive
in conclusion , although the unsafe online environment , spend too much time on internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks
it provides people with more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each others
it also helps people to develop their interpersonal skills through online chating
Overall , there are more benefits than the costs
the wolrd is incresingly becoming flat by all kinds of social network websites such as facebook and twitter
we can even know what a friend who is thousands of miles away eat for lunch though these kinds of social media
from some points of view , social really has a lot of advantages by letting us communicate with friends cheaper and more conveniently
However , its disadvantages also can not be ingnored when you cosider it as a platform to show off and a stage for cyber crime
social network sites provides us many convenience
without hanging out with friends or talking with friends through phone , we can know his latest news by scaning the webpage
it can help us know more about each other .
it can make people become closer as well
for example , if you find out that one of your friend 's favourite singer is Justin Biber through facebook , you can give him or her Justin Bieber 's new album or concert ticket as a birthday gift
it will be really sweet and you two will surelly become closer .
in addition , social network site can help keep in touch with friends living very far away
I met some canadian friends in Egypt
without facebook , we may lost contact .
however , thanks to facebook , I can still keep in touch with them and I know what they are doing recently as we living close to each other
the disadvantages of social network media are quite undeniable
A research shows that people will unconsciously hide their real thought when they say or post something that will be exposed to the public
it means that one can not know another 's real thought and personalities by reading things that he or she put on social network media
it will make him or her quite upset when they communicate in real life
in addition , with all those " nice " guys around on the social network website , one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook
it is a common scene that two people sitting next to each other seldom talk with each other but just look at their cellphone .
this kind of behaviour is not good to people 's psychological health according to a research
the cyber communication is quite different to face to face communication and people who depends on cyber communication too much will not get used to real life communication
in addition , cyber relationship can not always work in real life
with no close relationship in real life but only close cyber friends , one is more possibly to feel lonely because the physiological need of human beings is to feel the bond with others by our five senses
with the willing of people to become the best among others , social network site now become a place to show off
some people will to post their expensive thing or the oversea places of interest they have been on the social network and get a feeling of satisfaction by doing so
it is a mental unhealth and it may trigger people especially teenagers to become material .
the last but not the least , with all kinds of personal information on one 's social network page , it is covenient for criminal to make use of this information to commit a crime
above all , social network site is like a two sided knife and people can only take good advantage of it by avoiding the possible disadvantages of it such as putting less personal information on his or her facebook page
the modes of communication have been changing over the years , from letter writing to social networking
this phenomenon is caused by rapidly changing technology , which has made communication to be faster than ever before
today , social media sites , such as Facebook and Twitter , are relatively common within contemporary society ; and , people can communicate with each other , online or offline , on these social networking platforms
they can even make new friends over similar interests on these platforms , which will be able to connect almost everyone closely in many parts of the world
however , critics may argue that the existence of social media sites have reduced physical human interactions among people as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends
this essay will discuss both the benefits and down sides of using social media in the contemporary society
nowadays , social media are able to disseminate information faster than any other media
there are about 50 % of the people who have learnt about breaking news from social media
this is due to people spending comparatively more time on social networking than time on reading newpapers
Furthermore , with the current technology , smartphones are able to get access to social media sites which have made it easier for consumers to use .
hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediate to the people around them
However , critics may argue that not all information or news disseminated are reliable
there might be false information or hoaxes spreading around on social media
for example , in 2012 , there were false rumors of fires , shootouts , and caravans of gunmen in a Mexico City suburb which had spread through Twitter and Facebook
this had caused panic among the people who had flooded the local police department with numerous phone calls , and this had resulted temporarily closed of schools
the spreading of false information can be a potential psychological threat to everyone , given that social media can disseminate information in a realtively fast speed
Nevertheless , there are cyber polices who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes from spreading around
but , there will still be unreliable sources spreading false information on social media sites despite high security to control almost every social networking movement
Social media are able to improve relationship and make new friends , provided that there is mutual trust and mutual understanding between both parties
Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location
in the past , people used to writing letters to their friends and it will take relatively long time to send the letter over .
Therefore , with the help of technology , people are able to catch up wth each other conveniently
Furthermore , it will be easier to make new friends find who have simliar interests or hobbies .
however , in order for people to maintain their relationship as well as making new friends , it requires mutual trust and understanding between both parties
it might not be accurate to judge the other party 's feelings over social media as one may cover up their emotions while on social media
in addition , there are also chances for people to miscommunicate with each other as they can not sense the tone of the other party over social media platforms
this will result in unnecessary conflicts between two parties over miscommunication
but , if there is trust and mutual understanding on social media , it will be ideal for people to improve relationship and make new friends
in conclusion , social media in contemporary society is able to help one improve relationship and make new friends , as well as , disseminate information efficiently to the masses
However , there are risks of false information and chances of miscommunication
Nevertheless , the advantages of social media will benefit the masses if the negative aspects of it can be carefully taken care of
all-in-all , social media is the product of rapid technological advancement and there are more to come in future
Advantages : Social media sites have greatly ease long distance communication and interaction due to its accessibility and convenience
with a globalised and interconnected world today , Twitter and Facebook are now the mainstream platforms for social interaction
with just a touch away from any meida / electronic devices , one can easily interact and communicate with his friends without much hassle
Thus , long distance relationship or friendship can be maintained and keeping in touch with your circle of friends has been made much easier
with the sharing of personal photos , posting of status of one 's personal feeling or experience and being able to reply to these posts allowed human interaction to be engage and expand with ease
Introverts or those who are shy to communicate with their friends are now able to do so in the form of words via social media platform
Thus , socialisation can occur seamlessly and effectively with the utilisation of such social media platforms . Meet-ups and appointments are no longer a barrier for humans to contact and communicate with one another , making human interaction possible at one 's own convenience
the society will adapt to such phenomenon as physical interaction are transformed into cyber interaction
with the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the Internet , a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advanced and adapted to the highly connected world
this will greatly help a society to progress rapidly .
disadvantages : One of the main concerns of using social media platform to communicate is credibility
the certainty of what is being shared or expressed could not be proven physically as media limits this physical interaction , except when using a webcam to chat
we can not be certain for sure the reliabilty or truth of some posts or information we received through the Inetrnet
we may in actual fact communicating with a hoax Facebook acccount of a cyber friend , which we assume to be real but in reality , it is a fake account
photos and informations retrieved from their profile page may be fabricated to suit certain personal agenda
Thus , the lack of face-to-face human contact through social media restricts actual interaction which can be stimulated through the media
although emocons can be used to show certain emotion , this differs from the real authentic emotion of your friends when you observed them through their body language and their facial expression
the danger of such media socialisation is the uncertainty of such communication due to lack of physical interaction
Furthermore , this lack of physical interaction has affected human inter-personal behaviour since communication is made through social media instead of meet-ups
this lowers the human ability to interact with one another which can adversely shape one 's behaviour
the lack of exposure to real life interaction with humans with not create the confidence and skills needed for one to interact seamlessly and effectively with others
Therefore , for an effective and efficient society , there is a need to have a balance of both social media interaction and face-to-face human interaction within its people
nowadays , people can even use their phone to read news and everyone can be the first witnesses of what is happening in the world
people use Twitter to follow the artiste or celebrity they love and Facebook to see what is their friends ' recent activity
Nevertheless , they still can use phone to do normal call and message to contact .
not only the phone did the jobs for them , but also devices like personal computer , laptop , tablet , and many other devices which are able to connect to internet
it is obvious to see that internet saves people 's time and also connects people globally
Several arguments have been made regarding social media actually have some inevitable disadvantages to people
people can only use electical devices to access internet
Whenever they need to use social media , they have to use a phone or internet .
Generally people need they eyes to look at the display screen of their phone or computer and fingers to manipulate the corresponding device
as a result , they will lose eyes to contact and hands to express their feeling to people nearby them , which means they have lost the tools they need for face-to-face contact communicating
this can be easily seen in restaurants or cafes nowadays
a family of four having dinners in a restaurant without any chatting , because their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork
a group of friends having high tea in a caf é without chatting as well , because they do not know what to talk about but pressing on their display screen
the children nowadays do not know what is neighbourhood games and who is staying beside them , all they know is pressing icons on the screens
these are some concrete examples of how socia media reduce face-to-face human contact
when people get use of socia media to contact other people , what will happen is that their interpersonal communication skills will degrade and lost eventually
Firstly , they have lost the courage to meet strangers , not even the ability to talk .
also , they will not have enough experience to communicate with people in face and not be trained in their conversation skills
as a result , social media helps them do the jobs but indirectly affects their interpersonal skills
social media does have some other advantages beside their general benefits to human being
first of all , people saves money by using internet to contact other people and reading news
a father may be able to make a call to his daughter who is in other country via socia media software instead of making international call which costs a lot to normal salary family
he can even talk to her daughter face-to-face using video call via internet
Secondly , people makes friends all over the world and able to update their friends his recent activity easily
a guy who is going travel for months can easily tell all of his friends about his activity
when one of his friends who is not aware of this has failed to contact him via telephone calls , he might be able to get his whereabout using social media
these are the advantages that save works most of the time
in conclude , socia media benefits people in several ways but in the same time harms people
people should avoid the misuse of socia media and use it in the proper way
with the aids of social media , people bonds globally , information flows rapidly , and human lives happily
all of us are living in the technology realm society
Have you ever wondered why we use these tools to connect ourselves with other people ?
it started withthe invention of technology which has evolved tremendously over the past few decades
in the past , we travel by ship and now we can use airplane to do so
in the past , it took a few days to receive a message as we need to post our letter and now , we can use e-mail which stands for electronic message to send messages to our friends or even use our handphone to send our messages
from the example that I have mentioned earlier we can see that distance between us and our loved one are getting further apart
this is because by the ease of technology such as airplane , some of our friends might be going overseas to continue their studies or even you are away from your family to pursue your studies or careers in life
Thus , this makes Twitter and Facebook become one of the medium that we need
however , everything in life has positive and negative effects
this is applicable to these social media sites
the next two paragraphs will be discussing about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society
with the help of social media tools , we can stay in contact and keep ourselves up to date with our family and friends even though we are away from them
Social media sites such as Facebook has allow us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas
this approaches help the parents to communicate with their children and know what kind of activities their children have when they are overseas .
the social media is beneficial as it connect you and your loved one even though you are separated by distance
it might not be able to replace the joy that you have when you are with your family but it could help to reduce the sadness of being away from your family
as I mentioned in the beginning , there is also disadvantages of social media tools
One of them is that it reduce the level of concentration especially among the youngsters
this is because it is part of everyone 's habit to check their facebook 's page as their friends will post something new every second .
Thus , you can see that some students will browse facebook while attending lectures
this means that the students are not concetrating when they supposed to do so
as a result , it could affect their lives and studies
this will then lead to stress as these students are not able to cope with their studies because they were distracted
in my opinion , every individual has to take responsibility of their own lives by making a right decision
there are advantages and disadvantages in using social media sites , however in this case striking balance between social media and lives is the most important thing to do
nowadays , the use of sociall media platforms is a commonplace in our lives
in increasingly globalised world , such platforms even enhances and compliccates the links between indivduals in the world
Thanks to them , people can get to know one another online , without having to travel to meet up for business purposes or personal reasons
however , it is also bringing some social changes whereby such virtual worlds are overtaking the real-life world , resulting in some negative impacts in individuaul 's daily lives and therefore becoming a large problem in societies as a whole
as people spend more and more time on such social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contacts has decresed
as people feel more confident online where they do not have to face in real-life on the spot , they feel more comfortable and thus prefer communicating online
this results in lack of interpersonal skills in individual , especially young students as they always have option to turn their back to the real-life and go online .
this becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but to face things in real life
as they are so used to having an online avatar , they may lose their self-identity in real life and may not realise how to interact with people in real-life
another problem with social media is that , the benefits from investing such enormous time and energy is not relfected as something positive to the users
the reason why it is so addictive is , that the more people get into the social media , they seek attention from their friends
However , such sparks of sudden attention is extremely short-termed and gone eaily thus does not add any value or meaning to the user 's life
also , according to a research , it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people 's lives
but seriously , most people only post the happiest moments in their lives
Social media definitely has some other strong benefits that make users stay is the links among the people
Indeed , I myself use Facebook just because of the friends ' contacts that I want to keep .
however , the friendship on such virtual world is so superficial which is not so relevant to the real-life
also , as numerous profit-driven companies realize the hugh human traffic on such social media sites , they make it as a pond to fish the customers by uploading many advertisements
Furthermore this also possibly triggers the privacy issues as the Facebook allows some other profit-driven companies to have access to the information on the users
as this happens , users are more and more pron to any possible frauds
social media sites are at their peaks at the moment , however , I believe that when people realize that such sites are not making them better persons in real-life , they will not be indulged in it as much as they are now
the users , soon , will realise that they do not need such social media sites to keep in contact with their friends because , if they really need somebody , they will reach the friends no matter what
we think we are all connected through all sorts of social media , but do we really get connected or falling apart ?
Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are born with the intention of connecting people , from around the world
the idea seems great , and nowadays most people even the older generation will have at least one social media platform like Facebook .
the parents are now the " friends " of their kids , and they can now " follow " their kids more closely and on real time
people post about their random thoughts or daily activities via Twitter and post different kinds of photos on Facebook frequently , to be connected with their so called friends
however , as we then tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced in face-to-face human contact , that eventually affects our interpersonal skills
first and foremost , I would like to share on the advantages of using such social media in my daily life
as a student , I tend to meet lots of people from different background and at different settings
we may meet only once but we exchange our contact numbers as well as facebook account in order to keep in touch
Unlike just keeping contact numbers that we may not even call , social media like facebook is a great way for friends from different field or even from different parts of the world to be connected
Within clicks , we could check on the friend 's profile and read on for his / her updates
on another hand , we could update our profile by posting on the wall and our friends could read up on the newsfeed
this allows friends that may not have the time for meet up to still be connected in a way
not only that , new friends can be easily met through such online platforms
hence , our social circle is indeed expanding .
Nonetheless , what seems to make us connected can be the cause that falls us apart
the obvious disadvantage of using social media is the time reduction on face-to-face contact
this subsequently leads to poor interpersonal skills that inhibit the growth of our real social circle
for example , we tend send a birthday wishes when Facebook promts us " today is someone 's birthday " .
in fact , we may have just forgotten our friend 's birthday .
we used to send wishes cards during festive season like Chinese New Year , and we feel so good to write one and of course to receive one with stamps on it
gone were the times , and now we do mass sending and the receiver may feel less meaning in such online wishes
as time passed , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined
in a nutshell , every sword has two edges
the users of every social media sites need to strike a balance between the real world versus the virtual one
we should maximize the benefits of such platforms but be careful of its impacts on the actual life that we have
Ultimately , the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face-to-face meetings but social media sites are only the tools to enhance it
nowadays , social media sites are commonly used in the society
I believe 80 percents of people plays social media sites
these sites play the role of connecting people around the world
it consists of the function of connecting , sharing , interacting and advertising
however , there are also some disadvantages which occur due to social media which are concerned in the society
Therefore , this article is written to explain the pros and cons of using social media in our daily life
first , with the function of social media sites that connects the people , everyone is able to interact and communicate with friends and families , or even strangers without any time and place constraints
Through the social media sites , we can chat with our friends who stay in Europe and New Zealand
there are over thousand miles between Singapore and these two countries
however , we are able to chat with our friends without travel to the countries
it saves a lot of money and time as well as strengthen our relationship although we stay at different places around the world
Besides that , company also can use the convenience of social media sites , such as Facebook chat or Skype to facilitate the meeting with parties from around the world
substantial cost is saved without tiring travel from one point to another point
with the huge amount of cost savings , this capital can be utilized in other sectors which benefits the company more and boost up the company 's profit
however , there are two sides of stories always .
some scholars argue that the usage of social media reduces the face-to-face connection between human and animal
since ancient times , human interact with others face by face
without the facial impression , it is easier to misunderstand the intention of speakers
that is why facial impression is one of the most important elements in social learning
in addition , " social media sites will affect writing skills " , that is the point of view in society
based on the statistic report , the more of the writing skills will be reduced when the more time is used in social media sites
I believe most of us have the experience of suddenly forgetting how to write a word that we should know .
the auto correction software is so effective when using electronic device until we did not realize the importance of writing
Writing is an essential skill of person who express their own feelings and opinions .
' Privacy ' , this is the word that popular in these few decades
Human has their own rights and privacy
I believe that most of us agree with these terms
however , there is news about social media sites leaking users ' information to companies with cash reimbursement
everything we type in social media sites is recorded in the server and then transferred to the companies for spying and advertising
Although it looks like no laws and it is your own space to speak and do anything you want , you are actually wrong
you are not only controlled by government laws but also spied by the government
in conclusion , everything has two sides of stories
it is our responsibility to identify the advantages and disadvantages of social media sites
to utilize the technology well , we should do our effort to not only balance pros and cons but also lengthen the pros and shorten the cons
Thus , the new technology will be able to bring a prosperous future for our and next generation
with the wide spread of advanced technology , social media sites are becoming more and more popular
getting connected on social media such as facebook and twitter has become a main trend as well as daily work nowadays
with this situation , both advantages and disadvantages of using social media apply to our daily life
on one side , it is obvioualy that many advantages have been brought to our lives
Social media provides people with the opportunity to get contact with each other every time and everywhere
whether we are at home or at school , at work or on a holiday , we are able to communicate and interact with our friends
even when people are thousands of miles apart , social media make it possible to have interaction by keep writing comments
when our phones are accidentally done , we can also use the social media to get contact with our friends
some people who are try to talk in public can also actively take part in the group chatting via social media
Besides , we can make more friends by such interactions when our friends also bring their friends in .
the popularity of social media sites have made it more convenient for people ot update friends ' status and contact with friends more frequently
on the other side , we need to rethink about the influences brought by the social media
there are still many disadvantages of using social media
Firstly , interpersonal skills may be affacted by the reduction in face-to-face human contact
while social media brings convenience to people life , people are more and more willing to use social media for chatting instead of face-to-face chatting which has a time and place requirement
people who are not good at public chatting may be more reluctant to talk to people , and their interpersonal skills can never be improved under this situation
Secondly , people 's over-addition may avoidably , to some degree , exacerbate social alienation , and this kind of alienation causes some social media users to suffer from the over-dependence of virtual social networking
more and more networking has been transferred to internet from real life
this is a potential danger for teenagers who are growing with social changes to get hurt .
thirdly , a lot of updating of luxury living standard as well as other show-off situations may make people 's daily life more and more grandiloquent , which is not an accurate social trend
Lastly , it is easy for people to waste a lot of time using social media
again , there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addition and their study and work may be greatly influenced
since we can see both advantages and disadvantages of using social media , and we can not deny the huge benefits that have been brought to us , this main trend may be still lasting for a long time
Therefore , everytime we use social media , we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid be affected by the disadvantages
only by absorbing the essence and discarding the dregs can we make better use of social media
in the sophisticated era like these days , experts keep producing inventions that are meant to make life easier
Geographical and transportation borders are not a problem anymore because communication and information technologies were enhanced continuously
Telephone may be perceived as a big innovation created ever since the first time Graham Bell introduced it .
however , since internet were known , telephone started to give way to social media sites
many advantages are given to the users
Let us take example from Facebook and Twitter , two of the most famous social media sites
through Facebook , peope are able to maintain relationship with their old acquaintances
this benefit can not be obtained through telephone or mail because people 's particular and address may change from time to time while on Facebook , people can keep in contact with old friends just by using name and photo , for example , as the identifier
Facebook is like a combination of message and chatting service , personal profile , media of sharing , and other entertainment add-on ( i.e.
social games ) which allow users to communicate with remote people , and also to update and express themselves at the same time
Twitter , that has more simplified function compared to Facebook , gives more benefit if used as information sharing media
Twitter only allow users to give update that is limited to short sentences in order to spread the words fast , that only highlighted messages are delivered
for Facebook , a comprehensive way of sharing is offered since multiple photos and videos can be uploaded , long notes can be published , even documents and data can be shared through Facebook nowadays
these advantages also comes in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile application in our smartphones
despite the luxury that is offered by social media , there are also harmful side effects which people may not realize it beforehand
Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people addicted to social media sites has been decreasing
as the consequence , it affects their interpersonal skills
people can think while typing and prepare what they want to say but in face-to-face communication , every word that comes out of your mouth and may be not well arranged is the picture of your personality
this skill requires practices and can not be done completely through social media
there is a situation where a family is having a dinner together in a restaurant but everybody is busy with their own gadget , posting picture in Facebook , updating status on Twitter , or even chatting with friends
these social media serves a purpose to bind people in spite of their geographical boundaries but it does n't mean that surrounding people are neglected as the payoff
this is related to interpersonal skill that is mentioned before , that can be decreasing qualitatively if we are used to facing gadget , not facing human being
another disadvantage that affects other people is that by only showing selected part of our lives , we build " false image " in public .
we tend to only share our happy moments in media
because of this , other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness with no problem at all
other people then are influenced by us and tend to do the same
as a result , people think of theirselves lowly and may lead to depression and mental disorder
it also reduces our sympathy
this is a serious social problem and affects a lot of people
as explained above , modern and sophisticated technology does n't always give advantages
there are a lot of disadvantages that people may not realize of
it is up to people 's discretion and comprehension to decide which side they want to take .
so , we should never forget to think of and calculate the benefit and loss of every decision that we make .
nowadays , the advancement of technologies improves the life of many people a lot
in most of the countries , there is an emergence of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter
many people think that the social media sites have benefits on communication between people while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for society
one of the advantages which are carried by those social media sites is that they can connect us more closely than before
in the past decades , when the social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away by using a phone , or even a letter
however , calling a person by using a phone and writing a person a letter require some cost , and sending a letter to a person who live far away , especially in villages , takes much time
the appearance of those social media sites causes those problems to be solved
people connecting through social media sites can spend no money on communication , and also take only one or a few seconds for the message to reach them
Therefore , this advantage of social media sites saves money and time , and also provides convenience for many people
Moreover , this also provides an alternative way for people to contact a person whom they did not see for a very long time , such as their friends in primary school and secondary school
as we graduate from a school , we will probably lose contact with some of our friends
some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses , and we are not able to find them through a phone or a letter
if phone and letter are the only way to contact them , we would probably not be able to find them
Facebook and Twitter can serve as an alternative route to make connection between us and old friends
hence , the social media sites serves as a platform for connection
everything that comes with benefits will also have their disadvantages
on the other hand , social media sites also bring some negative impacts for the people and society
the advancement of those social media sites makes people so rely on them that some of them rather prefer using those sites to contact each other than talking to each other face to face
many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought by social media sites
the usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life , which will in turn cause the loss of interpersonal skills for many people
as we all know , interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with each other and to present our views and ideas
the loss of interpersonal skills results in the inability for people to well present their ideas
as a result , they will gradually decrease in their ability to compete with each other in society
in conclusion , social media sites cause both positive and negative consequences for people and society
as a part of this modern society , we should learn to distinguish between good and bad impacts brought by the advancement of technologies , and also learn to avoid the cons and maximize the benefits of those sites
with the advancement of technology in recent years , the need to keep in-touch with people and latest news has become a tremendous demand
some of the famous examples would be social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
with an increasing users of more than billion users from all over the world , social media sites have demonstrated clearly its success in playing an important part of our life
however , there are arguments that social media life brings in a reduction in face-to-face human contact , which in turn affects interpersonal skills
let 's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and society
first and foremost , all social media sites are free
all users ' needs are an internet connection and an email account so that everyone can have a Facebook or Twitter ID to start their journey in social media life
Secondly , it helps people to keep in-touch with one another
finding old friends through Facebook , for example , is more easier than asking people around in real life
Social media helps to lessen the hassle of geographical distance and brings people closer
thirdly , social media sites keep us up-to-date on latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world , all with a click away on the refresh button
last but not least , social media sites also link people together through allowing us to create our own groups , pages or sites to share our hobbies , interests and studies in particular subjects
hence , it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our global inter-connected world
however , social media sites also have its second side of negative impact on human .
Undeniable , it becomes more addicting when we spend more time busy socialising and interacting virtually
we spend majority of our time on sites like Facebook , Twitter and it affects our daily work productivity and performance
in corporate world , employers often block social media network to prevent employees from spending their office time on their personal leisure rather than concentrating on their work
using text-messaging language as an informal way of communicating on social media network also brings in a bad impact for us in the long term
the more time we spend on these sites , the lesser our time spent on face-to-face interacting with one another
hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone
in addition , there are also some false reports and fake IDs occur on both social media sites that people use fake ID to insult or harass someone , like the case of Heather Chua occurred recently on Facebook
these malicious comments often go viral and it creates a strong negative effect on the real user in real life , which might lead to unwilling attitude to interact with others in real-life by the victim
in conclusion , everything has its two-sided affect and it depends on how we exploit it
with current booming technology , it is agreeable that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each others through social media sites , however , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays even a more important aspect in our life
as more and more social websites such as Twitter , Facebook and Weibo have become ubiquitous , seamless and imperative in our life , people may worry about the young generation having problems in face-to-face communication skills
however , I believe that the benefits brought by these online chatting rooms tremendously outweigh their repercussions
Social media enables us to explore the world far far away without paying expensive airplane tickets and sparing a one-week holiday
the convenience is beyond description
with a small smart phone or a computer at school , at work or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with a ' click ' and get to know about their life through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos and status updates
Compared to face-to-face interaction , online conversation is easier for strangers to open their mouth to each other
since some of the information has already been revealed on the home page , it is also easier to find some common topics to talk about
Moreover , people usually like to share boldly about their real feelings online with their masks in reality being taken off
this has been indicated in a report done by Boston University in 2012 , 80 % of information posted online is true while a person may like 3 out of 10 times in real life
this shows that a facebook friend may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a facebook account .
that is because we are acting who we are in reality while we have no reason to do that in the online virtual world
although sometimes genuine sharing of information may be inappropriate or even harmful , such as prevalent use of vulgarity and harsh-meaning comments , we can minimize those repercussions through strict regulations of content online
another advantage of social media is in aiding the spread of democracy
people around the world could easily share their thoughts about their governments
that eliminates the incomplete information disadvantage for some remote rural regions where people are less aware of what actually is happening around them
one of the examples is the 2012 riots in Egypt and Zambia
the idea of searching for democracy is passed from Egyptians to people in Zambia quickly through the use of social media
However , as the government controls most of the media
these social media may be tools for their campaign and manipulating the thoughts of the public
for example , in 2012 general election is Singapore , Dr Tan Chee Keong made use of facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public
though because of this , social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas compared to other traditional medias
Intensive use of Social media does reduce the time people spend in face-to-face communication
it is commonly seen in a food court or restaurant that a group of people sitting together around a table with each of them having a cell phone in their hands
they are too busy with their way too many virtual friends and some of them neglect the feelings of their real-life friends
in this case , I have to say that to err is human .
what we can do is to educate the public about the importance of their friends just by their side and teach them how to manage their time well
in conclusion , the use of social media has more advantages than disadvantages to our daily lifes
what we can do is to cautiously manage our time spent online and manage our words used online
with the regulation of government and relevant authorities , the virtual world would be a better world
social media sites ' role in connecting people around the world is undeniable
Thank to those social media , the communication among people all over the world is possible and can be done with ease
Apart from the ease of communication despite of the distance , many other advantages such as knowledge sharing and trades can be done through social media as well
Nevertheless , with those advantages , some disadvantages may appear such as reduction in face-to-face human contact which affects interpersonal skills , privacy issue , as well as some frauds that can be done through social media
Twitter , Facebook and Skype are some social media sites which enable us to keep in touch with our friends or family who are in other cities or countries
through those sites we are able to talk to them , to know what their activities are and who their friends are , etc . From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance
the sharing of information can be done faster through social media as well , that is why nowadays many news publishers make their own social media account , for example Channel News Asia has a twitter account and will update its follower with headline news
that shows how actually news and information can be shared easily through social media
Furthermore , since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media , these information can reach them easily without them need to watch or listen to the news reports
Due to the popularity of social media , many people start to do their business via these sites
more and more advertisements can be found on Facebook , whether it is our friends who sell their products or professional brands selling their products online , we can get to buy and contact the sellers through those sites , which can be considered as an advantage for us , the buyers
however , is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually compared to when we meet them personally ?
I do think there is difference in it and I believe many of us will agree .
when we write or communicate virtually , we can hide our through feelings and many not become ourselves since we do not want the other party to judge us
other than that , sometimes the message of one party can not be delivered properly to the other one since communication is done through written language , and thus the ' tone ' of the message sent and when it is received may be different
many people are very brave in telling people about their opinions online but in real life some of them can be very shy and not outspoken at all
this will lead to a bad inter-personal skill as well as a problem of trusts
nowadays we can not really trust new people whom we know from social media since we will never know whether they are even'real '
some people fake their identities in media sites so that they can know more people or some may even cheat others
in addition , privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place
Therefore , while social media sites are undoubtedly have benefits in our life , we should consider its drawbacks and thus use it wisely so that we can gain more of their benefits and disadvantages us in the smallest way possible
it is a common scene that almost everyone in a public transport is watching at phone or wearing a pair ear piece in this modern society today
not only one but many developed and developing countries have the same picture
some say that it is a necessary step for human revolution
Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular among people in order for them to connect with others even from different countries
it also brings many negative effects such as loss of face-to-face communicating skills which is important in their working place
this essay will discuss about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life
one of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site is that people can reach each other easily , even without contact for a long time
in this fast pace and competitive world , people may not be able to keep in touch with others
with the help of social media site , people are able to upload their new discoveries and funny scene on it and they can be updated with the new information of their friends
Personally I am study in oversea , busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friend
using a common social media site with my friends to help me know what are their statuses nowadays
and I am able to easily find a common topic when I contact them
in Singapore , many Malaysian cross the sea to work here
many of them are busy in work and separate with their children
one of Manager in my working place has the same situation
after my Manager taught her mother how to use Facebook , she was able to upload video clips of her grandchild
Therefore my Manager would not miss the moments of her daughter 's growth
social media sites are also a very useful tool for people to start a new friendship or relationship
people get connected or closer with same preferences
it is easier for people to approach the other after knowing the information
Students can exchange their experiences in study even when they are in different countries
people are able to share the culture or pretty photos online , therefore others can spread the joy with them
Thus I believe that social media sites are one of useful tool to help people know each other better .
however , social media site is a double-sided sword , it also bring in some negative effect on our daily life
one of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people lose the interest of face-to-face communication
many people like to use language to pretend themselves , and lost confidence when they talk to each other
although not everyone is good at public relationship even without the existence of social media sites , we can not deny that it do affect some people in their ability of interpersonal skills
in conclusion , the shadow always exists when there is light
we should take advantage of the creatures we create and try to avoid the negative effects
Social media sites suppose to be a very useful and convenient tool to use and bring people closer in this globalised world
the use of social media has largely influenced our ways of communicating with one another
Online friends became real life friends and real-life friends communicate with one another online
Social media has changed our ways of exchanging information and interpersonal relationships profoundly
there are advantages and disadvantages in this change
Social media has reshaped the way of communication
in real life , we communicate with one another as equal participants
we share ideas , stories and forge friendship based on mutual respect
however , communication on social media is largely based on " broadcasting and listening " .
when we use facebook and post pictures and statuses
we are actively " presenting " fa ç ades of our lifes in front of others
we tend to post pictures with the best looks , status that are funny
we broadcast these facades of us to others
the images we choose to present are tentatively considered
the audience is not some specific person , but everyone we might know , or even the entire world
there is an element of seeking out for attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks
on the other hand , the viewers , are not the listeners
they are just scrolling down pages of pages of pictures and statuses and see one of them which they might think it funny
it is not the broadcasters themselves they care about , but the content
this type of communication does not help forging interpersonal relationships
in real life , establishing friendship requires the all-rounded understanding in one another and the caring for one another
the latter requires face to face interaction where we can show our emotions to the other .
one can not truly understand a person with only stalking his / her facebook page where he / she carefully chooses what to present .
one can not truly show their emotions by texting some =) signs
the broadcasting and viewing model is not good for forging relationships
however , it is good for sharing information
on social media , everyone is a broadcaster and a viewer
with my social network account , I seldom read newspapers or go to news websites anymore ; because I can easily read them from the status of my friends
if I am interested in politics , I can just follow some politics newspapers or public figures
I get news for sales , clothes and cosmetics from my friends
if some of my friends have horrible taste on clothes and he / she posts them often , I can simply block him / her off
information got circulated .
the most popular information get circulated the most so I can seldom miss it
social network plays a role in providing and also filtering information
this saves a lot of time for me in reading newspapers and watching TV
Personally I feel more at ease on social medias
from the above two points of view I think social media could forge more interest-based friendships
with the help of social media , I become real life friends with those from online forums whom I share the same interest with
I also discover some of my friends ' interest which I find common with myself so that talking to one another is much more about life , study , friends , etc
the communication does not focus on how we feel , or to say , each otherm , but whatever is interesting , or the content
in this case , interpersonal skill is not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody , but to get the information that we are both interested in
in conclusion , I think social media has reshaped interpersonal relationships from a more human-based friendship that requires sharing and caring between friends , to a more information-based friendships that requires a mutual interest
there are advantages and disadvantages in itself , however , whether it is good or bad we are still not sure
it is just different .
Advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life
people that living in the modern world really can not live without social media sites like Twitter and Facebook
almost all students and young adults possess the Facebook or Twitter account
it is true that social media makes people be able to connect one another more conveniently
however , it seems that , especially for some , sharing some parts of their lives such as videos and photos on social media sites become really necessary
an extremely interesting and ironic phenomenon was discovered that a group of friends met and sat around one table , but none of them were really chatting with one another .
instead , all of them were more interested in posting pictures of this " cheerful " meeting on their social media sites
Therefore , there is need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media
Social media enables people from different parts of the world to communicate with one another .
people used to write letters and send post cards to keep in touch with ones who live far away from them in the past
it can take a few days or weeks for those to receive the messages
nowadays , what people need to do is just typing in front of the computer in their own rooms
and people on the other side will only need a second to receive the message
Distance and time are no longer the problems , which is convenient especially when instant chat is needed
however , when people become more and more addicted to this convenience and fail to communicate with people who are close to them , their face-to-face interpersonal skills are lost
Social media provides people a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a communication method
when ones chat on those media sites , there is no eye connection , no emotion delivery and even the expressions are typed in by using some combinations of punctuations
for more convenience , sentences are shortened to simply three or four words such as lol ( which means laugh intensively ) and " asap " ( which is as soon as possible ) .
people indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they can .
while , once they are communicating with people in their face , expressing themselves appropriately become really a big problem
Social media also provides people huge information about people and things that they interests .
for example , on Twitter , it is exciting to follow people that you adore like famous movie and series stars , business men and entrepreneurs
it makes people feel extreme close to their admirers ' lives and works
Updated news people care about can be easily obtained when you refresh your social media sites on your smart phones and laptops almost every time at any time
however , after one has registered in those social media sites which are not reliable , all the information you have filled in will be a weapon against you in the future
Furthermore , not everyone on social media sites is honest
the profile picture may not be the person who that user says he or she really is
the reason might just be that he or she just wants to " decorate " his or her face
but there is possibility that the person on the other side is deceiving you in order to obtain your information against you
no pledge of authenticity risks people 's information and privacy that are shared on social media sites
to sum up , social media has advantages and disadvantages in people 's daily life
it shortens the distance between people from all over the world and makes instant communication possible
and it becomes more convenient to obtain and update information by using social media
on the contrary , social media makes people lose their ability to communicate effectively in their real lives and makes people risk exposing their privacy to those whose identity can not be verified on the social media sites
how do social media help change our lives ?
as the development of the technology , social media becomes more and more significant role in the whole world
everyone in the world can not stop using it every day to express their feelings or ideas and a log of other stuff which helps their friends know their lives better
However , it also raised the concerns about whether it brings us more benefits or a human disaster
although it helps to connect us with our friends wherever we are , it at the same time reduces the chance for us to talk to our friends face to face which may affect our interpersonal skills
Thus , whether there are more advantages or disadvantages becomes a tough question for every human being
many people says they will support social media since it really helps them to have a closer view about how their friends are going in other parts of the world
this is especially applicable to people who are overseas .
to them , social media is the only resource they can approach to know everything happened in their home country and the way they can use to show their lives to their lovers as well
What 's more , these days social media plays an important role in spreading information .
nowadays , people can just easily put their renting information on their facebook account and wait for response from others who are from different parts of the world which brings us a huge amount of convenience
it is quite significant especially for those young teenagers since they would rather go to these sites to see the news and know what happened in this world than read the newspaper every day
However , there are also a great amount of people who are against this technology
they worry a lot about the bad effect on the teenagers who are still developing themselves
they pointed out that actually social media reduces the chance for us to talk to people around us face to face
the more we care about facebook , the less time we will have to spend with our friends .
nowadays , it is quite common to see on some party , people would more prefer looking at their phones and reading all the posts on facebook if they feel bored .
it makes people worry since if all the teenagers continue using social media frequently , they will decrease the ability to talk to people
they will feel it becomes difficult for them to find any topics to communicate with other people
Personally , I strongly agree that social media brings more disadvantages compared to advantages it gives us
although it is really useful when we need to use it to let other people know we really live a good life , it wastes us a lot of time as well
Think in another way , if we put those time we spend wandering on those sites , we may already finish one book or do other more meaningful things
we should keep in mind that there are still ways for us to contact our family or friends
everything will be bad if we do n't know how to use them wisely no matter whether it is really good or not
as a result , it is important for people to know that we need to be cautious about the time we spend on these social media
as stated above , I strongly believe that if we can use social media wisely rather than abusing it , we will all live a better life
the advantage and disadvantage of social media
nowadays , as the technology is becoming increasingly advanced , more and more social media sites are showing up in our daily life .
you can see people playing Facebook , Twitter through their smart phones or ipad on buses or trains
some may say that the appearance for these modern media will reduce the chance for people to communicate face to face
this essay will illustrate the pros and cons of using social media in modern society
Firstly of all , social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and contact each other
Years ago when these modern products have not been popular , the way for people to communicate or contact people far way are still restricted in making phone calls , sending emails or writing letters
some will take long time and some are not efficient enough for people to get their response
however , social media solves these problems well
people can contact their friends on the internet and get their reply very fast
the communication is also not limited in words
people can express themselves through pictures or emotions
people can also get to know their friends ' state and mood by looking at their posts on line
Moreover , people can be aware of what is going on in social situation and see the comments online and share their opinions on these websites
social media makes people 's life much more colorful and provide a lot of fun
however , social media may do some harm to people 's life
it will make people spend more time on chatting on the internet rather than communicating face to face such that interpersonal skill will be badly affected
some people spend a lot of time in it and forget their real life
Actually , I have seen some people are very funny and interesting when I am chatting with them online .
however , they behave quite boring when I talk to them in real life
Teenagers are developing their interpersonal skills and social skills when they are growing up
if they spend too much time on these social media , it may cause some problems to their mental development
they may feel uncomfortable when they communicate with people face to face
some may share fewer and fewer time with their family and not knowing how to express themselves
Moreover , some wrong values on the websites will affect teenagers and confuse them
some may even do something wrong
in conclusion , the showing up of social media sites is a double edged sword
it can make our life simpler
people can promote their friendship and relationship through these social media
Whereas , it can also make people forget to communicate to their family and friends in real life and affect negatively to their interpersonal skills
but overall , the advantages far outweigh its disadvantage
so we need to make best use of these social media and make it a fun way of adding some excitement when life is boring
and try to bypass the shortcomings
remember to send greetings to our friends and family frequently
nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to communicate wherever you are .
the appearance of social media sites truly connects people closely
people can know their friends ' recently looks and interesting things happens on that people just by checking their facebook or other social media sites
we can not deny that the social media sites truly make old friends do not lose the information and the chances to communicate with you even if you are in a different country
however , the social media sites truly reduce communication in face-to-face which truly affects interpersonal skills
there are two advantages and two disadvantages of using the social media in people 's daily life
Firstly , the social media sites can connect people with their friends and parents closely
by typing the words and showing the pictures , people can express their emotions that they are too shy to express
for example , on mother 's day , people are shy to say " I love you " to their mothers so they can type it on his or her mother 's facebook page .
then his or her mother will also know the emotion and feel warm
on the other hand , when the teenager is studying in a foreign country , the internet is the only way that he can communicate with their parents and friends .
Therefore , the social media is truly good for people
Secondly , social media sites can not only connect people with their friends closely
people can also know much information about the celebrity in Twitter and Facebook such as Obama , Bill Gates and get the first-hand study materials on it
they can learn how these people succeed and they can also have the chance to talk with them and know these famous persons ' thought by using the social media
On the other hand , with the help of social media , some homeless people or someone who need the money to cure the disease can get the help from the world quickly because once one person know the information , his or her will share it to their " friends area " , then many people will know it and spread the information to the person who can give help .
on the other hand , there are also problems with the population of the social media
Firstly , when people rely on social media to communicate with their friends and parents , they will accustom to communicate by typing and not talking
people even prefer to talk to their friends and meet their friends online and gradually reject face-to-face communication
the social media truly limit the interpersonal skills such that people lose the chance and the ability to practice talking and connect the relation between him and their friends
Secondly , without truly communication in real life , people lose the ability to see the truth and false
there are many people in the social media with beautiful image and good content in their pages , however in real life , he or she may not have jobs or live poorly .
Teenagers may believe these people and easily be cheat and lose money even their safe
the social media is not safe which is bad to teenager 's future development
all in all , the appearance of social media truly helps people a lot in many areas
however , there are some disadvantages which will affect people in some degree
Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Social Media in Our Daily life and Society
nowadays , with the development of technology and society , social media become more popular and even important in our daily life .
we communicate with others using social media , such as twitter , facebook and microblog more and more frequently
there is no need for people to go out of their home to interact with others , they chat online , share pictures , tell others what they have done or funny stories
it seems that people build a good relationship with others by social media , but the problems come out
Pepope do not know how to talk with others face to face , especially the strangers
then , we need to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in your daily life and society
as for the advantages , there are two aspects : more convenient to contact others , easier to know about others
one advantage is that it is more convenience to contact others by social media
in old days , if one wants to tell some important news to another one , which lives far away , he needs to write letters and it wastes time
the long distance and time-consuming make spreading the messages very difficult at that time
Therefore , people may not contact with faraway friends and relatives unless there is something important .
however , people now can contact with anyone all over the world who can use computer at any time , and there is no time delay of messages
the other advantage is that it is easier to know about others by social media
if there is no social media , it is difficult for people to know about a stranger
they may collect information about that person by asking his friends , colleagues or family members
and the information collected may not be intact and true
Unlike today , with the help of social media , people can easily get information they want just by searching on line , and know about what that person did everyday at what time
as for disadvantages of social media in our daily life , wasting time , causing illness related to sitting long time before the computer , quick spread of rumor and fake news , most importantly , making people lost the ability to talk to others face to face confidently
it is weird that people sit around the table but all face to their phones and do not talk with each other
if there is a joke on their facebook page , they may talk to others in this way , " hi , look , how ridiculous this is " , then they laugh together
no matter it is a party , dinner or just simply get-together , there always are some people bow their heads and playing their phones even their family and friends are in front of them
in a conclusion , there are both advantages and disadvantages of using social media in daily life
people should enjoy the advantages of social media while be aware of the disadvantages of that and try their best to avoid the disadvantages happen to them and their friends and family
today world is considered to be the era of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter which are attractively connecting people around the world
However , some people worry that social network can affect interpersonal skills as it reduces face-to-face human contact
the advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in society are elaborated on as follows
Nobody can deny social media 's advantages as the benefit it provides in connecting people regardless of nationalities , races , cultures and languages
Social media is a trending channel and a suitable mean of communications
Firstly , social media brings convenience to the world
it has erased the boundaries of distance and time
no more worries about the time it takes to deliver letters and packages
nowadays , thanks to the help of social media , with just one click , you can contact your family and friends wherever you want .
you can share photos , videos and every meaningful experience of your life
more importantly , it is cheap and easy to use social media
Secondly , social media network opens the door of opportunities for people due to its great benefit in connecting
a lot of fresh graduates can find jobs thanks to Facebook and Twitter
Young people can widen their relationships , meet new friends and learn wonderful things in many parts of the world
in business area , social media is a good tool to develop and advertise products and services
on the other hand , social media also has disadvantages which have created worries to the society recently and made it a controversial phenomenon
more and more young people tend to live in social media world most of their time and reduce face-to-face human contact , which can affect interpersonal skills and relationships in social life
first and foremost , we should realize that social media world is not trustworthy and real
everyone can easily make up the personality and characteristics they want
they can become anyone
though social media do create relationships , relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction
there is a story of a girl who lives in social media world every night in eight years
in the chat room , she created a close relationship with eight people
she talked with them every night , trust them and share her life with them .
then eventually , she discovered that eight people became one as he was using eight different identities to chat with her all the time
Furthermore , the convenience of social media is also its weakness
A lot of people use their true information on social media sites , which can lead to crimes and deception
people can use the information to deceive family and friends and banks to do bad things such as blackmail , ATM theft and so on
last but not least , social media does affect human interpersonal skills when people increase their time on social sites and reject chances to expose to social daily life activities as well as interacting with people
Recent research has shown that the more people spend time on social media sites , the less they become ambitious .
as a result , if the situation keep go on in this unexpected trend , it will cause a bad effect on the young generation
to put it in nutshell , everything has its own pros and cons .
so does social media network
it not only is convenient and beneficial in connecting people and developing the business but it also can damage people relationships and interpersonal skills
social media is only beneficial as long as we know how to use it in a correct and suitable way with the combination of both social media sites and daily life interaction to develop people 's potentials to the fullest
