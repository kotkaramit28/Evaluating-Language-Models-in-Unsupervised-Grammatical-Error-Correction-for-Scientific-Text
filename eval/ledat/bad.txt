 The fact that MATH is a divisor of MATH immediately implies that any schedule for MATH of length lesser or equal to MATH must not contain idle times .
 It is obvious that any schedule for MATH of length lesser or equal to MATH also has to contain no idle time units .
 If MATH is larger or equal to incumbent utilisation then the move is accepted , otherwise it is rejected and another move tried .
 Note that there is an implicit assumption that it will be given a set of events that is large enough that the maximum utilisation will be less than 100 % ; otherwise the landscape will be flat , precluding meaningful hill-climbing .

 More in-depth work needs to be performed on demonstrating the ability of the new load metric on distinguishing different load status .
 Moreover , the metric of availability defined based on the new load metric , MATH , also offers an opportunity to characterize the overall availability of a cluster of servers .
 If the operation of each server is assumed to be independent from each other , then the overall availability of a cluster of servers can be expressed as the sum of the availability on individual servers .
 Our proposed sculpturing technique outperforms common image algorithms , when the number of hotspots and , hence , the number isotherms to be represented are less -LRB- which is usually the case as we are interested only in high temperature regions -RRB- .
 However , this problem can be overcome by using image segmentation so that each segment in turn has fewer number of hotspots and , hence , isotherms .
 To manage the policies collected by our Aggregator Source , we then built a new Aggregator sink , called Authorization Service , which organizes FGAC of Grid nodes and queries the security policies , according to the RuleByGroup strategy described in the paper , to extract the set of Grid nodes the policies of which authorize a request .
 Until this point in this paper we considered the two party case only .
 A hyper-heuristic operates at a higher level of abstraction .
 The main aim of the hyper-heuristic is not to compete with the state of the art problem specific approaches , but to provide a general framework which is able to deliver solutions of good quality for a wide range of optimization problems CITE .
 In order to accomplish its enlarged role , the OntoGazetteer must be able to record various types of relationships between places , including spatial -LRB- proximity -RRB- , topological -LRB- adjacency , containment -RRB- , hierarchical -LRB- territorial subdivisions -RRB- and semantical , also recording the motivation behind each relationship .

 We assume in this study that each non-inferior solution of -LRB- REF -RRB- is attainable .
 This is because TCP can not allow the source node to quickly learn exact congestion situation in wireless networks .
 TCP performs worse dramatically as the round-trip time increases , and even can not work if the end-to-end connectivity is broken .
 Such event may happen frequently in mobile networks .
 Moreover , some characteristics of wireless networks , such as unreliable radio channels , shared-media and terminal mobility , cause certain networking functions such as routing to perform poorly , which further degrades TCP performance .
 In this contribution we focus on a method based on white-light interferometry that might yield the same level of security that QKD achieves CITE .
 In section 2 we describe the core idea of the method .
 Different possible attack patterns and the necessary extensions to retain the security are described in section 3 .
 As you see , the cost is the number of input operations from disk that are necessary in order to have the answer to the problem `` does there exist a key MATH such that MATH ? '' .
 The probability for a congestion to happen within domain MATH is given by MATHDISP , where the second production indicates the probability for no congestion to happen all the way from domain 1 down to the ingress node of domain MATH .
 It is geometrically well-known that the regular triangular lattice pattern is asymptotically optimal in terms of the number of circles needed to entirely cover a target region in the plane CITE .
 However , this result is not directly applied to WSNs because the sensor network needs to not only be covered but also be connected .
 In CITE some examples of natural and synthetic chemical systems are described , which could be of some interest for the proposed chemical middleware , including : -LRB- i -RRB- radioactive decay -LRB- MATH -RRB- by which chemical substances fade ; -LRB- ii -RRB- Lotka reactions CITE -LRB- e.g. MATH -RRB- modelling the dynamic of prey-predator -LRB- MATH - MATH -RRB- populations ; and -LRB- iii -RRB- diffusion rules -LRB- e.g. MATH -RRB- by which a chemical substance gets transferred to a neighbouring compartment , ultimately supporting concepts related to field diffusion as discussed in Section REF - notation MATH stands for a molecule MATH to be sent out of the compartment .

 Equivalence of deterministic and nondeterministic automata
 for any MATH , a set MATH is a set of tuples -LRB- relation -RRB- , with empty relation MATH , unary universe-relation MATH , and binary relation MATH for the `` equality '' type MATH .
 We take the time-derivative of MATH along the trajectory of the system -LRB- REF -RRB- and -LRB- REF -RRB- , MATHDISP where the general functions MATH , MATH and MATH , are defined in -LRB- REF -RRB- , -LRB- REF -RRB- and -LRB- REF -RRB- , respectively .
 For the first term of -LRB- REF -RRB- , we apply -LRB- REF -RRB- , -LRB- REF -RRB- and -LRB- REF -RRB- to get MATHDISP where MATH and MATH are constants .
 Using -LRB- REF -RRB- the third term of -LRB- REF -RRB- can be rewritten as MATHDISP Finally , we apply -LRB- REF -RRB- - -LRB- REF -RRB- to the second term of -LRB- REF -RRB- to get , MATHDISP where MATH and MATH are constants .
 In this work we introduce we introduce 2-way deterministic tile sets to resolve the problem : we call a set of tiles 2-way deterministic if each tile is uniquely determined by the colors on its north and east sides , as well as by the colors on the opposite south and west sides .
 From the fact that the domino problem remains undecidable even when the input instance is 2-way deterministic we conclude new undecidability results for reversible cellular automata .
 In a junction tree , exact inference proceeds as follows : Assuming evidence is MATH and MATH , MATH is absorbed at MATH by instantiating the variable MATH and renormalizing the remaining variables of the clique .
 Mathematically , evidence propagation is represented as CITE : MATHDISP where MATH is a separator between cliques MATH and MATH ; MATH -LRB- MATH -RRB- denotes the original -LRB- updated -RRB- potential table of MATH ; MATH is the updated potential table of MATH .

 For example , for hyperplanes we find the best simple binary test with parameter MATH by discrete search and then set the initial guess MATH .
 Interestingly , even the basic Paxos protocol we outlined earlier can accommodate dynamic membership : papers by Lamport and others have shown how to do this by using a two-level quorum update scheme ; one to change the membership , and the other to do quorum reads and writes during periods when membership is n't changing .
 With the Paxos scheme , such a replica can just repair itself and restart ; if any updates managed to commit while it was down , they obviously wo n't be reflected in its durable state , but this does n't matter since subsequent reads and updates need to access a quorum and will find at least one replica that knows about the event .
 Otherwise , it would n't have been able to commit .
 Unfortunately the automaton is nondeterministic and in the worst case it is forced to explore all computation paths , with a time complexity non-polynomial with respect to the length of the source string ; more efficient algorithms are wanted for practical application .

 Here MATH is given by : MATH where MATH
 The original definition of dependability is : the ability to deliver service that can justifiably be trusted .
 An alternate definition that provides the criterion for deciding if the service is dependable is : the dependability of a system is the ability to avoid service failures that are more frequent and more severe than is acceptable .
 An implication for routing , per-se , is that modern routing algorithms do n't have time to search tables or perform other kinds of classification that might require memory references : there is time for a single lookup but not much more .
 Then , after following similar procedure to obtain Eq . REF , MATH can be computed as : MATHDISP where MATH and MATH .

 On the other hand , it is a consensus that optical networks will play a critical role in the future Internet due to its immense network capacity that metallic media like copper wire can not offer CITE .
 However , for the time being , there are neither cost-effective photonic computer nor optical buffers , especially optical random access memory , available for optical networking .
 Since all these elements are essential for network functions like routing and congestion control , how to realize green optical networks is a difficult issue since energy consumption will become the major factor in limiting super-high speed optical core networks in the future Internet CITE .

 Since a typical monitoring configuration is not only a `` one-to-one '' mapping of the higher-level concepts defined in the SLA but it rather includes a set of interrelated configuration elements -LRB- e.g. , configuration files , database entries , agent configurations , evaluation rules , database triggers , etc. -RRB- , the creation and maintenance of this set of configurations can be a tedious and error-prone task .
 This is particularly interesting if the monitored infrastructure is subject to frequent changes or the requirements defined in the SLA are rather complex , however , both the system model and the related IT monitoring and management need to be maintained in a consistent and coherent manner .
 Additional optimization of this process , such as updating only the part of the monitoring configuration , which really needs to be changed , can also be implemented .

 Since about 2001 , two significant trends are reshaping the whole computer ecosystem : the traditional CPU evolution did hit the now proverbial `` power wall '' , meaning that further increases in clock speed could only be achieved by dissipating disproportionate amounts of power and were therefore no longer feasible , and special purpose architectures start to rival GP CPUs in the performance/power and performance/cost metrics .
 Intel 's and AMD 's answer to the `` power wall '' are the current line of multicore CPUs that derive their performance from up to eight complex , independent execution units -LRB- cores -RRB- and no longer from increases in clock frequency .

 We have further shown that , if only a part of these properties were met , then we can solve the problem given the order in which the accepted jobs are to be executed .
 First note that the dummy variables can be safely removed from formulation -LRB- REF -RRB- .
 Thus we use the following , simpler formulation : MATHDISP
 There is an obvious one-to-one correspondence between the feasible solutions of problems -LRB- REF -RRB- and -LRB- REF -RRB- , and this correspondence preserves the objective values .
 In addition , since MATH is of running time MATH , the second property of MATH yields that MATH , and therefore MATH .
 The multinomial term frequency NB -LRB- MN TF NB -RRB- represents each message as a set of terms MATH , computing each one of MATH as how many times it appears in MATH .

 Hence , in order to prove the lemma , it sufficiently to show that MATH .
 However , Fishburn also presented orders MATH such that MATH for each MATH , which means that surprisingly MATH can be a disconnected set .

 If the system is n't consistent about which members are operational , it may neglect to update one of the replicas , in which case that replica will start to give incorrect information to the pilots and controllers who are unlucky enough to query it .
 Conversely , if we can trust a membership service to tell us which processes `` belong '' to the system , we 'll be in a position to use that information in support of simple tools , like libraries that maintain replicated data and provide ways to lock items for exclusive use , and then in higher level algorithms , for example to rapidly `` fail over '' from a process that crashes to one that remains healthy so as to maintain near-continuous availability .
 Thus , only shifts along the ridge -LRB- i.e. along the edge -RRB- cause little change in MATH .
 Writing a square matrix as a product of idempotent matrices attracted the attention of several Linear Algebraists .
 Remember that MATHDISP .
 A system MATH of closed , convex cones with common apex MATH in MATH is said to be separable if there exists a hyperplane MATH through MATH that separates one of the cones from the intersection of others .
 Compatibility with the Internet : Plutarch subsumes the Internet as a context ;
 The PITM model CITE is tailored towards defining UC where the environment is a master process and the adversaries are regular processes i.e. , MATH .
 Depending on which entities are involved , different computational models are defined : the real model -LRB- involving the environment , the real adversary , and the real protocol -RRB- , the ideal model -LRB- involving the environment , the ideal adversary , and the ideal functionality together with dummy parties -RRB- , and the hybrid model which is a combination of the previous two models .
 Thus we will present a new approach to solve this problem that is called optimal multicast multi-sources routing -LRB- OMMSR -RRB- .
 In fact we have MATH SSMSs that each of them starts from source node MATH and terminates to group of destination nodes MATH .
 This means that MATH MATH or MATH starts from source node MATH and terminates to MATH destination nodes MATH .
 Therefore , the number of sources nodes is MATH and also the number of all destination nodes is MATH .
 Also , such simulations often require the ability to acquire additional resources , if e.g. a certain simulation event occurs that requires the spawning of an additional replica .
 This capability is also useful for applications where the execution time and resource requirements can not be determined exactly in advance , either due to changes in runtime requirements or interesting changes in application structure -LRB- e.g. different solver with different resource requirement or a different workflow path CITE -RRB- .
 It does prove infeasibility of these four infeasible instances in less than MATH seconds and finds a first solution for these two feasible instances in MATH seconds and MATH seconds respectively .
 Within one second both our methods Restart and Hot Restart were able to prove the optimality of substantially more instances than B&B MATH .
 To encrypt a message MATH with keys MATH it is sufficient to encrypt MATH with MATH , i.e. compute MATH , and then compute a message authentication tag for MATH using MATH , i.e. compute MATH .
 Thus , the total electric-field vector MATH can be obtained as the linear combination of the unpolarised and the completely polarised field vectors CITE , which is given by MATHDISP , where MATH denotes the transpose of a vector and MATH .
 Adam J. Glagell demonstrates that pure permutation algorithm is vulnerable to known-plaintext attack , and hence its use should be careful considered CITE .
 If MATH , it means that all the neighbors of the node -LRB- and all their sub-trees -RRB- have converged .
 From the recurrences -LRB- 3 -RRB- , we see that the calculation of MATH is state-type dependent .
 The maximum over all possible choices of child states MATH is the sum of three terns : an emission term MATH , a transition tern MATH and the score of the optimal parse tree rooted in MATH that generates MATH has already been calculated in the DP-matrix cell MATH .
 Furthermore , we get the three-dimension view of the execution processing of the CYK/inside algorithm as shown in Fig. 3 .
 The processing starts by those elements located in the edge of bottommost triangular layer -LRB- E-states , length 0 subsequences on diagonal , cells marked by red color -RRB- .
 The computation moves along diagonals in a wavefront mode until reaching the right-angled vertex in current layer .
 When the last cell MATH worked out -LRB- the cell marked by green color -RRB- , the CYK/inside algorithm returns .
 When MATH the community detection algorithm gives perfect results .
 In this game there is no trusted party , instead , the simulator MATH is given as input MATH 's witness MATH .
 Then the output distributions in the simulation and in game Game MATH are computationally indistinguishable via a standard reduction to the security of MATH .
 We proceed by induction on MATH that is the size of MATH .
 Notice that we may assume that MATH has no partner , otherwise we can immediately apply the induction hypothesis .
 Now MATH is matched to some randomly chosen MATH .
 One can check by the definition of MATH that the weights of the elements of MATH are invariant if MATH had no partner .
 If MATH had the partner MATH then the expected new weight of MATH is at most MATH .
 Now by induction one can see that for the resulting smaller subproblem the random algorithm has expected cost MATH .
 If MATH , then all the units of order MATH are early -LRB- see Figure REF -RRB- and we have MATHDISP
 The number of extra one-way function invocations induced by truncation related alarms is expected to be MATHDISP , for each Hellman table .

 In what follows , we list some other problem variants based on different assumptions , objectives or other coverage models .
 In the MU MIMO BC , the BS is the transmitter thus each channel matrix , MATH , is of dimension : MATH .
 The capacity of the MIMO BC , MATH , is commonly cited as follows , under the assumption of unity noise variance : CITE CITE : MATHDISP
 We obtain that MATHDISP
 Because of MATHDISP we finally obtain that MATH .
 If MATH and MATH consist of the only point MATH , then MATH and , therefore , MATH .
 In the case MATH , that is all the points lie in a line MATH , then the subspace REF is of dimension 1 and is spanned over the linear function MATH such that MATH .
 An initial rotor trim code based on 2-D aerodynamics is followed by a vortex-lattice free-wake analysis , that is then coupled with a roll-up model in order to identify the higher-intensity vortex structures .
 The distance matrix stores the sequence similarity that it is used in the next phases .
 This step is implemented by a master-worker paradigm using a Guided Self Scheduling method -LRB- GSS -RRB- .
 Already fiber based optics helps replacing thousands of comparatively heavy copper cables and connectors which link up to hundred electronic boards that can be contained in a modern satellite .
 WDM techniques are very attractive in this context since they allow a space multiplexing of several channels in one physical link , realized either as a fibre or as a waveguide structure .

 Ontology based Access Control Model for Security Policy Reasoning in Cloud Computing
 Due to the result in Lions and Magenes CITE , it is well known that for every MATH and MATH , there exists a unique solution MATH to the initial-boundary value problem REF in the space MATH .
 So , following the line of the proof of theorems cited above , the reader can easily show that the OCP REF - REF has a unique solution MATH in the class MATH MATH , provided this problem is regular .
 However , as we will see later , the same result remains valid in less regular space of admissible pairs - namely in the case when we take MATH instead of MATH .
 Therefore , if for instance MATH is only a group , then for any MATH and MATH we may naturally define MATH .
 In particular , Strong Blackbox with placements of the master process as considered in CITE and Universal Composability with placements of the master process as considered in CITE implies Universal Composability with placements of the master process as considered in CITE .
 A human subject stands at about 2.5 m away from the wall and looks at -LRB- 1 -RRB- horizontally aligned markers one by one , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- vertically aligned markers one by one -LRB- Figure REF left and right respectively -RRB- .
 The structured grid requires a multi-block approach in order to overcome the topological limitations which arise when meshing complex geometries .
 For example , one of the integrated solver -LRB- PanAir -RRB- requires that no gaps exist at the common interfaces , where other solvers -LRB- UPM -RRB- do n't .
 Even if it is usually good practice to avoid such holes , and thus this has been set as a general rule .
 The structured grid generator GUI layout is depicted in Fig . REF
 Provide an FSM based solution for Alg .
 Then there is a long-term UC secure protocol MATH for zero-knowledge with relation MATH -LRB- i.e. , realising MATH -RRB- using a polynomial number of commitments from prover MATH to verifier MATH -LRB- i.e. , MATH -RRB- .
 Once the surface normal MATH has been obtained at every pixel , the global illuminant direction is the solution to the following linear equation MATHDISP , where the matrix on the left-hand side has a size of MATH , and the right hand size is a 3-element column vector .
 Arguably the most salient property of the UC security definition -LRB- and other security definitions of the same kind like RSIM CITE -RRB- is the so-called composition theorem .
 One flavor allows MATH to invoke an arbitrary number of instances of the subprotocol MATH or MATH , respectively -LRB- universal composition theorem -RRB- , while the other , more restricted flavor requires MATH to invoke only a single instance of the subprotocol -LRB- called the simple composition theorem in the following -RRB- .
 For UC with respect to reactive polynomial time , however , the universal composition theorem holds -LRB- see below -RRB- of which the simple composition theorem is a direct consequence .
 Also , what we 're slowly working toward is a software design where each game object deals with its own stuff .
 Accumulate the curvature between two neighboring corners thus yielding the curve of accumulated curvature .
 -LRB- b -RRB- The goal is achieved whence machine MATH is operating on an instantaneous power that is scaled as the MATH - th lowest power consumption of machine MATH .
 The construction of a QN can be split in two steps : definition , that includes the representation of service centers , their number , and the interconnection topology of the network ; parameterization , that aims at defining the input parameters of the network , that are : the arrival processes or the number of customers , the classes of customers , the service rates or latencies , scheduling policies and queue lengths at the service centers , and the routing probability over the network branches -LRB- given by the customers ' behavior -RRB- .
 We first show a basic trapdoor commitment based on RSA -LRB- see CITE -RRB- and later show how to make it into a MTC .
 The triple MATH are the public parameters .
 For example , these two previous rules would produce the decomposition scheme for task REF AI-DFS shown in Figure REF .
 We shall explainBoolean variables that take theBoolean values of 0 or 1 andBoolean operations applied to them .
 The mathematical system based on these is called apredicative logic orBoolean logic .
 If 1 is related to the truth and 0 to the false , the predicative logic becomes the basis of discussing the correctness of inferences as well as the basis of exploring the relationship between inputs and outputs of the gates that constitute hardware of computers .
 Apart from the variations in the definitions and the method employed to identify communities , there are many variation in the final desired solution .
 As an example , several researcher aim to find the entire hierarchical community dendrogram CITE while others wish to identify only the optimal community partition CITE .
 The results are returned to the user , and are also forwarded to the cache .
 Otherwise , the cache replacement policy may decide to delete some of the currently cached results so as to make room for the newly computed set .
 Third , a rule based system was used to assign tasks to technicians .
 We present a new encryption scheme which is secure against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack -LRB- or CCA2-secure -RRB- in the standard model -LRB- i.e. without the use of random oracle -RRB- .
 As mentioned above , the difficulty can be resolved by using a doubly-enhanced TDP .
 When using a doubly-enhanced TDP , for any polynomial MATH , the sampler that outputs MATH , where MATH are random domain elements and MATH are random bits , is a MATH - oblivious sampler for the TDP based public-key encryption scheme .
 This fact follows from Claim REF , which states that even given the random strings MATH , which are used to sample MATH respectively , the bits MATH , where MATH , are pseudorandom .
 Thus , given MATH , the MATH plaintext bits that correspond to the MATH ciphertexts MATH , are also pseudorandom since they are respectively `` masked '' by the pseudorandom bits MATH .

 Results are discussed in Section REF
 Regardless of security issues , we first have to show that the protocol indeed computes the MATH - ranked item .
 We need to show that -LRB- a -RRB- The preprocessing performed in Steps 1-3 does not eliminate the MATH - ranked value and -LRB- b -RRB- The MATH value of MATH is the MATH - ranked value in MATH for each MATH -LRB- where MATH are the sorted sequences maintained by parties MATH , MATH , respectively , during round MATH -RRB- .
 From scenario one of Fig . REF and REF , it can be seen that the MFS strategy is the superior one .
 This is becuase , when the node 's storage is full , the MFS strategy only replaces the old group of replicas with the new one if it is found that it is more important than that group in terms of NOR .
 Thus , any replica in the replaced group might be requested in the future and in this case the node must bring it from another node which takes times and consumes the valuable bandwidth .
 Affiliation of the client , time of submission , and type of resource requested , are some of the possible attributes a Grid node administrator can use to specify a policy .
 The moving object should keep going in the direction to the target object -LRB- the object to be avoided -RRB- and deviate from the target object relatively close to it to be considered an avoidance .
 A counterexample is a person walking and one or more kilometers away he/she deviates from a security camera ; this person is probably changing his/her direction by any other reason and not for escaping the security camera , therefore , not characterizing an avoidance behavior .
 Moreover , that approach can be used to enhance the decision making process of an autonomic system .
 These results are in keeping with our expectations , again showing consistent behavior in low vegetation , while revealing the additional headroom available in the MATH response as the vegetation increases .
 Again , in terms of conditional probability , we have for all MATH , MATH , MATH MATHDISP .
 The network bandwidth should be factored in to efficient allocation as in , CITE , and should affect pricing .
 In CITE intra and inter-cluster communications are carried out thanks to the clusterheads .
 In CITE the authors propose a hierarchical structure for addressing and routing protocol .
 We first investigates the amount of handoff history needed to provide accurate next-AP predictions .
 Sometimes , a lower layer should n't even try to do so .
 First formulated in a 1981 conference paper by Saltzer , Reed , and Clark , the end-to-end argument -LRB- the `` proof '' of the principle -RRB- shows that the best way to achieve network reliability is n't necessarily to make the lowest layers of the network reliable .
 More specially , by Theorems 3.3 and 3.6 , we can also state
 If MATH is MATH used in TAE mode , then if MATH is a secure tweakable block cipher , MATH is pseudorandom .
 If MATH is MATH used in TAE mode , then if MATH is a secure tweakable block cipher , MATH is pseudorandom .
 The scenario for MitM detection includes three different financial institution .
 In particular , a CoMiFin Event is created whenever a customer logs to the home-banking web site of one of the participating financial institutions .
 Here we should perhaps pause an note that in fact , partitioning is n't an issue within modern data centers , because they use very resilient data center networking hardware .
 Thus the kinds of partitioning events that occur tend to isolate and `` kill '' a small number of machines , leaving the remainder of the data center connected and healthy .
 Transition 3 : Caused by the process scheduler when it decides to give a ready process the chance to run .
 An object MATH is called zero object if it is both terminal and initial .
 For example in MATH the empty set is initial , while any singleton set is -LRB- up to isomorphism -RRB- terminal object .
 Since , MATH is a deterministic function of MATH , given MATH let the ciphertext in the second stage be MATH with length MATH , i.e. MATH .
 We will also refer to MATH as IV MATH , or just IV ' when clear from context .
 In the previous part of this section we have seen how the mapping functions and the redistribution algorithm are employed in Clusterfile .
 In this subsection we present an analysis of timings of data operations in Clusterfile .
 Analysis for Hellman tradeoffs and single table -LRB- non-perfect -RRB- rainbow tradeoffs were done in CITE .
 For conciseness we group together such candidates and we write : MATHDISP instead of MATH .
 In order to perform this computation the signer must know the discrete log values of all of his public generators .
 Material in this chapter is mostly based on CITE .
 Yet we 're gaining powerful capabilities , and perhaps could compensate for the technical deficiencies in these areas using legal mechanisms : if we ca n't secure private data adequately with the tools cloud platforms offer us , we can at least jail those who steal private data and misuse it in ways that harm the individual .
 Gallager , Humbelt and Spira proposed a synchronous algorithm -LRB- MATH -RRB- with concurrent initiators to find the MST of a graph .
 This algorithm requires synchronization of each phase which may be provided by a synchronizer or a spanning tree of the whole network may be constructed beforehand as in the previous algorithm of MATH at the cost of additional messages .
 Additionally , different than the synchronous algorithms we have seen before , this algorithm also requires synchronization of all fragments within a round so that nodes in each fragment should be executing the same round concurrently .
 MATHDISP
 On the Y-axis this figure represents the reader threads referencing a node that is being removed from a dynamic structure .
 Concretely , it shows the changes suffered by a linked list containing three elements -LRB- A , B and C -RRB- while an updater thread deletes element B.
 For ease of notation we also define MATH of a server MATH to be the server in MATH that serves MATH .
 For ease of processing we also assume that the servers in a QoS satisfying set MATH are sorted according to their communication cost to MATH , i.e. , MATH , where MATH is any server in MATH .
 However , as advocated by Levin CITE in a somewhat different context -LRB- see CITE -RRB- , a better definition of `` flexible probabilistic efficiency '' is obtained by requiring that the running-time itself , as a random variable , be upper-bounded by a polynomial in a random variable that has expectation that is at most linear -LRB- in the length of the input -RRB- .
 In particular , Levin 's definitional approach eliminates the technical difficulties exemplified at the end of Footnote REF , and provides a robust definition of probabilistic efficiency ; that is , if a probabilistic algorithm is deemed `` efficient '' then also a modification that squares its running time will yield an `` efficient '' algorithm .
 In REF we extend Levin 's definitional approach to interactive strategies , pursuing the same alternatives as those presented in REF , and establishing analogous extendability and composition results .
 Proof.Since MATH is an invariant subspace of MATH , there exists a matrix MATH such that MATHDISP Indeed , let the matrix MATH is formed by the eigenvectors of MATH such that MATHDISP where each vector MATH satisfies the equation MATHDISP Here MATH are the corresponding eigenvalues .
 In the extended form , the relation -LRB- REF -RRB- is MATHDISP Postmultiplying this equation by MATH we get MATHDISP
 Then , the pre-multiplication of this equality by MATH implies MATHDISP that means that MATH satisfies -LRB- REF -RRB- .
 Then any other basis from MATH spanning MATH can be represented as MATHDISP and , hence , MATHDISP that proves the theorem .
 The third , and strongest version follows the same structure and formulation of the previous version -LRB- Version 2 -RRB- .
 In the ideal model of the explicit cheat formulation , the adversary can always cheat and obtain the honest parties ' inputs .
 If we are allowed to spend sufficiently enough time to solve the problem we can construct an algorithm , based on a context-free grammar given , to decide whether or not a string is generated by the grammar .
 If MATH for at least one of such sequences , the grammar generates MATH , and does not generate MATH otherwise .
 This is a typical example of brute-force search .
 When the number of the rules in the grammar is denoted by MATH , then the total number of sequences of rules of length MATH is given by MATH , which is an exponential function in the length MATH of an input string and becomes enormously large as MATH gets large .
 Hence the way to solve the membership problem can not be practical .
 In this sense , they do n't necessarily have to invalidate the claims listed in the patent application .
 But the variation is found to be consistently larger for the WINNER II scenarios whereas only negligible variation is observed for some of the SCME scenarios .
 A detailed investigation of the range of capacity variation as a function of angular spread in a single cluster model confirms this .
 Consequently , the more under-utilized a facility , the more expensive it becomes in terms of the total cost of ownership .
 Task status are exchanged to broadcast local knowledge on all nodes , and thus , to compute an accurate global view of the calculus .
 More recently , the work on dataspaces CITE shares some of the same characteristics as data integration in cloud intelligence , including uncertainty in the data , and pay-as-you-go data integration CITE .
 However , dataspaces are generally instance-focused and do not consider analytics functionality , let alone cloud intelligence .
 Pilot-Jobs have been used to -LRB- i -RRB- improve the utilization of resources , -LRB- ii -RRB- to reduce the net wait time of a collection of tasks , -LRB- iii -RRB- facilitate bulk or high-throughput simulations where multiple jobs need to be submitted which would otherwise saturate the queuing system , and -LRB- iv -RRB- as a basis to implement application specific scheduling decisions and policy decisions .
 A closer look at the Kol and Naor mechanism -LRB- in the non-simultaneous model -RRB- , raises another possible problem , namely the possibility that one of the parties has some prior information about the secret .
 Suppose that the long party has some prior information about the secret MATH , or has access to some `` place '' where it can check whether the possible current secret MATH is the real secret -LRB- e.g. the secret is a password to some web server , and the party can just type the password and sees if it works -RRB- .
 Blacklisting nodes is a delicate matter ; we want to place malicious nodes `` playing-dead '' on this list , while at the same time we do n't want honest nodes that are temporarily disconnected from being on this list for too long .
 We show in Theorem REF and Lemma REF that the occasional honest node that gets put on the blacklist wo n't significantly hinder packet transmission .
 This proof follows the outline of Theorem REF : supposing that there is a UM-adversary MATH that breaks the integrity of the emulation `` authenticated world vs unauthenticated world '' with non negligible probability MATH we can build an equivocator MATH for the MTC scheme or a forger MATH for the one-time signature system .
 More specifically , the MITC4 elements CITE has been used for the space discretization .
 These shell elements are three-dimensional solid but the typical constraints of the shell kinematics are forced .
 To avoid shear locking a mixed interpolation of the tensorial component has been adopted CITE .
 Two of these instances were examples of `` high volume '' MitM activities , in which customers login activities to the same service and IP address from distinct users were above the detection threshold -LRB- i.e. , more than MATH events in a MATH , see Figure REF -RRB- .
 The processing time is measured only in case of the DHT-based Container .
 In parallel with these steps , early model validation and analysis can guarantee that the monitoring configuration is correct and complete while the `` overmonitoring '' of the system can be also prevented by analysis of the thresholds and metrics -LRB- see the dashed arrows in the figure -RRB- .
 Interoperability and bundling of services are controlled by a Bundle Configurator and Assistant tool , designed to semi-automatically assist the creation of service bundles .
 The elements of this layer can be spun up or shut down very abruptly as demand varies A second row of stateful services runs behind the first-tier applications providing somewhat greater functionality , but at higher cost and with less ability to scale up or down as quickly .
 Assume the strong RSA problem is asymptotically hard with respect to a distribution ensemble MATH over safe prime products .
 Then the computational group family MATH of invertible integers modulo MATH -LRB- with the modular multiplication group operation , and uniform sampling procedure over MATH -RRB- is pseudo-free with respect to the same distribution ensemble MATH .
 Assume that MATH is not pseudo-free , i.e. , there is a probabilistic polynomial time algorithm MATH that on input a randomly chosen MATH and random group elements MATH -LRB- for some polynomial sized set MATH -RRB- , outputs an unsatisfiable equation MATH -LRB- over constants MATH and variables MATH -RRB- together with a solution MATH to MATH over the group MATH .
 In this section we consider the impact of parameter selection .
 Both methods have been largely studied in 1-D chains and 2-D fan-shaped or circular region as CITE .
 However , none of them studied the imbalance problem in the 2-D WSNs with regular topologies and formulate this mathematically .
 This geometry can be represented in different ways , e.g. , by a polygonal mesh , various types of splines , or level-sets .
 The area of a bounded and measurable set MATH is given by the following : MATHDISP
 The integration is for the characteristic function MATH of set MATH that is equal to 1 for all points in MATH , and equal to 0 otherwise .
 In a more extensive form , the definition reads as follows : MATHDISP
 The resulting loglikelihood is averaged over all 10 results ;
 The significant difference in the number of created states as shown in Fig . REF -LRB- a -RRB- and the wide range of task graphs for which this pruning technique is effective as shown in Fig .

 D. Lin et al. . CITE proposed a data protection framework that is composed of three modules named policy ranking , policy integration and policy enforcement .
 After finding the best service provider , proposed centralized model -LRB- for policy integration module -RRB- creates policies to be agreed by involving parties .
 Finally the policy enforcement module -LRB- uses either tight coupling or loose coupling -RRB- examines whether the confidentiality of data and policies are guaranteed at any time and at any location or not .
 Within the developed approach , time intervals where the electric energy receive different electric cost rates are identified -LRB- see figure REF -RRB- and they are charged at different rates .

 Lensch et al CITE captured 20 images of the measured object simultaneously with its shape .
 The authors fitted Lafortune lobes CITE to a sparse spatially-clustered view and illumination-dependent data representing a subset of BRDF values .
 As explained in Section REF DCC incurs in an additional performance degradation when it is ported from a shared-bus to a direct-network .
 As mentioned in CITE , this helps to illustrate the performance degradation occurred within a SMT processor when two copies of the same thread are running within the same core .
 Note that the only difference to the hybrid simulator from the proof the composition theorem in the classical UC setting is that MATH has no upper bound on the number of instances of MATH it simulates .
 In many cases , you will then discover that the program does n't exactly do what you want it to do .
 Here we use just one thread for each product in the B&B phase and several threads for the combination phase .
 This topic is well researched , and lot of work has been done in the context of SNs alone CITE , CITE , CITE , CITE and CITE .
 Hajibagheri et al. . CITE have given a framework based on Information Diffusion Model and Game Theory .

 However , as mentioned in Section I , to the best of our knowledge , an integrated framework of IoT and SNs have not been well explored .
 Extending Lifetime of Cluster Head -LRB- ELCH -RRB- CITE is yet another cluster based algorithm .
 Once the clusters have been organized , the CHs form a multi-hop routing backbone towards sink .
 The data is directly sent to CH by its cluster members .
 The intersection constraint thereby reasons about occupancy in 3D space , i.e. , the spatial extents of 3D objects should not intersect each other .
 For example , in figure REF f -LRB- right arrow -RRB- , Object Stereo assigns the top and the bottom part of the can to the same object , while the middle part is assigned to a different object .
 This volume intersection is physically very unlikely , whereas our results in figures REF c and REF d are physically plausible .
 Our second physics-based constraint , i.e. , the gravity constraint , encodes the observation that objects usually do not float in the air , but stand on top of each other due to gravity .
 In the first tier , we do see a need for replication and even value in supporting consistency , even though the data in question is soft state .
 True , we 'll discard any replicas that are bound to a service instance we shut down , or that crashes , but this does n't mean that consistency wo n't have a value .
 Indeed , one can imagine entire high-assurance services living entirely in the first tier , and doing all kinds of active mission-critical things , in settings as sensitive as health care , operating the smart power grid , or doing or air traffic control .
 Consistency relates to giving the right answer and is n't necessarily a function of data durability .
 Lin and Gerla described a modified version of the lowest-ID algorithm -LRB- MATH -RRB- to solve the problems of the above algorithms CITE and partition a network into non-overlapping clusters .
 They assumed every node knows identifiers of their neighbor nodes which may be provided by the physical layer .
 In particular , we consider two kinds of service knowledge : -LRB- i -RRB- a local service knowledge representation , to enable the definition of the semantic service descriptions intriduced in the previous section ; -LRB- ii -RRB- a network service knowledge , to conceptualize the notion of semantic links between peers with similar services , to improve service request forwarding throughout the P2P network .
 The time memory tradeoff curve for the DP tradeoff is MATH , where the tradeoff coefficient is MATHDISP .
 For any non-negative integer MATH , we know its MATH - analogue MATH , where MATH .
 At the end of this subsection we cite some auxiliary results that we feel are interesting per se .
 We recall that each of the sets MATH is the homothetic stretching of MATH at MATH times .
 Given a MATH - colored tournament MATH , as with standard color coding we will say that an arc set MATH is colourful if no arc in MATH is monochromatic .
 An ordering MATH of MATH is colourful if the feedback arc set corresponding to MATH is colourful .
 An optimal colourful ordering of MATH is a colourful ordering of MATH with minimum cost among all colourful orderings .
 We now give an algorithm that takes a MATH - colored arc weighted tournament MATH as input and finds a colourful feedback arc set of minimum weight , or concludes that no such feedback arc set exists .
 The wavelet multi-resolution tree method CITE represents a DT as a hierarchical multi-scale transformation associated with a 3D wavelet .
 The input trees are statistically merged to generate new outputs .
 Step III-3 For each vertex group MATH in MATH , calculate the average of MATH by : MATHDISP , where MATH denotes the number of vertices in MATH .
 We conclude that the probability the second event happens in an execution of MATH is negligible .
 Since the execution of MATH with multiple MATH is otherwise identical to the execution of MATH , we conclude that , MATHDISP

 Without loss of generality we may assume that MATH , MATH , since if MATH for some MATH , we may discard the redundant participants from that compartment without reducing the row space of the corresponding matrix .
 Furthermore , we may assume that MATH , since if MATH we may find a superset MATH such that MATH , MATH , and MATH and prove that MATH can not learn a thing about the secret with probability MATH ; since MATH has more information than MATH does , that will settle our claim .
 As far as a MATH is concerned we have the following .
 -LRB- This is because , MATH has possibly read other values that are no longer consistent with the value of MATH just obtained . -RRB-
 Furthermore , unless MATH is small , the assumption MATH can not continue to hold as MATH is increased , so that the tradeoff curve will eventually return to the usual MATH after a certain point .
 That is , there exists a projection function MATH that maps keys MATH into their projections MATH , such that there is an efficient algorithm that given only MATH , MATH , MATH and MATH a witness of MATH -LRB- which exists because MATH is in NP -RRB- , computes MATH .
 In our experiment all the mobile clients share the same access rate distribution .
 MATHDISP
 A non-tree -LRB- frond -RRB- edge which is not included in the DFS will also be traversed four times as two vis messages and two ack messages in both directions .
 Therefore the total number of messages traversed for all edges will be MATH .
 Total time taken by the algorithm is twice the traversal of the tree formed as MATH and also for every node there will be 2 units , one for sending vis and one for receiving ack messages .
 Therefore the total time is 4 MATH -2 time units .

 These efficiency issues as well as robustness of network control algorithms derived from game theoretic formulations in the presence of time-delay will be addressed in the following two chapters .
 Since the shape of the hotspot can affect estimation of hotspot center in thermal image , 6 types of hotspots are tested , which are `` sphere '' , `` horizontal cylinder '' , `` vertical cylinder '' , `` horizontal plane '' , `` vertical plane '' and `` random '' .
 We introduce an integer parameter MATH which define decomposition resolution .
 There is a vast amount of literature on lotsizing and scheduling models with setup times and costs .
 However , to the best of our knowledge , none is able to correctly handle both sequence dependent and non triangular setups for big-bucket models , let alone a combination of this and period overlapping setups .
 In Section REF we therefore give a detailed analysis of this single criterion subproblem and explain how the solution strategy is modeled in the predator-prey model as specific mutation operator combination .
 A consequence of Proposition REF is that the first coefficient of auto-correlation of a sample MATH defined by MATH , gives a statistical test especially well suited to detect biases in the bit-stream of random generators based on oscillators .
 -LRB- 1 -RRB- MATH is subadditive -LRB- superadditive -RRB- ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- MATH is subadditive -LRB- superadditive -RRB- .
 By the mathematical induction we shall prove that MATH holds for any MATH .
 On previous works CITE , the authors have implemented an ad-hoc FPGA cluster called SMILE , composed up to 16 FPGA nodes and a host computer monitoring the cluster operation .
 Currently each node consists of a board that includes a Xilinx XC5VFX70T FPGA with two PowerPC 440 microprocessors , and Gigabit Ethernet connectivity used for communications between the boards .
 The board also contains a DDR-SRAM controller , System ACE controller -LRB- for compact flash memories -RRB- etc. .
 With all these elements it is possible to run a complete Linux kernel inside the PPC microprocessors , using all the programs and libraries available for this operating system .
 It follows from CITE that this yields a CCA-secure scheme under the decisional linear assumption .
 the hash functions in the family are collision-resistant ;
 for every function MATH in the family and for every two messages MATH , the distributions MATH , MATH , induced by the random choice of MATH , are statistically close ;
 there is an oracle that on input MATH returns a random MATH such that MATH ;
 the security of commitment schemes still holds in a model where there exists such an oracle .
 if MATH is a non-top job , then the pivot is the top of the pyramid having the index MATH , the job being necessarily on MATH ; the free job is the immediate job being immediately located at the right of the pivot on MATH ;
 if MATH is a top , and if the t-pyramid it characterizes holds some non-top jobs , then the pivot is MATH and the free job is the job being immediately located at the left of the pivot on MATH ;
 if MATH is a top , and if the t-pyramid it characterizes does not hold any non-top jobs , then the pivot is the next top on MATH at the left of MATH having still some non-top jobs in its pyramid , the free job is the job immediately located at the right of the pivot on MATH .

 When we want to analyze the kernel and its plugin , it is very simple approach to insert REF print-out statements into the source code .
 Unfortunately , the source code of most targets is unavailable and , if available , it is hard to determine the proper location in where the information is .
 At the first time , the kernel debugging tools are used to achieve this : KGDB CITE and KDB CITE .
 A user checks the target in advance , and they send a debugging signal generated by hardware interrupt at the corresponding condition or position .
 However , they shows only primitive hardware states like register values and memory maps thus it is still hard to retrieve the information what we really want .
 To analyze the target more precisely , that is getting high level information , another approach is proposed : Gprof CITE , Gcov CITE , .
 These are called the static analyzer ; they scan the source code of the target and gather the information such as function?s elapsed time and its execution count .
 Unfortunately , the source code of most targets is unavailable and , if available , it is hard to determine the proper location in where the information is .

 Unfortunately , the source code of most targets is unavailable and , if available , it is hard to determine the proper location in where the information is .
 By giving chance to call pre-defined function , each analyzer can get the trace of library invocation and system call .
 However , since the insertion points are very restricted , its application is also limited .
 Because they can insert any instrumentation in any place , it provides extensive analysis .
 Memory check CITE , which is unable to be analyzed by static method , is feasible to be detected .
 But there are some gap between the target of the kernel and applications .
 We collated the characteristics of the target of kernel analysis , and compared it to that of application analysis .

 Examples of browser based attacks -LRB- HTML based services -RRB- are - SSL certificate spoofing , attacks on browser caches and phishing attacks on mail clients CITE .
 This suggestion is rooted in the realization that an important aspect of -LRB- deterministic and strict probabilistic -RRB- polynomial-time as a model of efficient computation is the closure of polynomial-time under natural algorithmic compositions .
 The problem is that , in the case of `` flexible efficient probabilistic computation '' , directly upper-bounding the expected running-time -LRB- as underlying the definition of expected PPT -RRB- does not provide closure under natural algorithmic compositions .
 But upper-bounding the expectation of a root of the running-time does deliver the desired property .
 Every simplex contained in the ball and covering its center has an edge such that the distance from its midpoint to the center of the ball is smaller than MATH .
 Every simplex contained in the ball and covering its center has an edge such that the distance from its midpoint to the center of the ball is smaller than MATH .
 Basically , for every convex body that possesses this property with some constant MATH the value MATH can be estimated by MATH , regardless of the dimension .
 Furthermore , the functions MATH and MATH have the following Taylor-Maclaurin series expensions : MATHDISP and MATHDISP , respectively .
 Now , upon equating the coefficients of MATH with those of MATH and the coefficients of MATH with those of MATH , we get MATHDISP , MATHDISP , MATHDISP and MATHDISP .
 Now , replacing MATH and MATH into MATH and MATH yields : MATHDISP
 A suitable evaluation metric would therefore be measuring precision at a fixed - typically low - number of retrieved results , generally the first 10 or 30 documents .
 On the other hand , it is the least stable of the commonly used evaluation measures and it does not average well , since it is strongly influenced by the total number of relevant documents for a query .
 The reaction might involve some state transition , and in addition one out of the following three possibilities :
 Clustering algorithms generate either a hard or soft partition of the input dataset .
 Clustering algorithms generate either a hard or soft partition of the input dataset .
 For example , even for a small dataset of 19 patterns to be partitioned into 4 clusters , we may have to consider around 11,259,666,000 partitions .
 In order to reduce the computational load each of the clustering algorithms restricts these possibilities by selecting an appropriate subset of the set of all possible MATH - partitions .
 In chapter 2 , we consider two partitional algorithms for clustering .
 One of them is the MATH - means algorithms which is the most popular clustering algorithm ; the other is the leader clustering algorithm which is the simplest possible algorithm for partitional clustering .

 In this paper , we set the center of transformation with respective points according to location of silhouette as shown in Fig . REF .
 For all of equations in our paper , we express matrices and vectors with the capital letters to indicate the equations as matrix forms , however , in the figure , lines are denoted with the lower-case letters because those are not matrices .
 In the figure , MATH denotes vanishing line which is parallel to the x-axis and goes through the cross point MATH .
 MATH is not shown in the figure cause of limitation of space .
 MATH and MATH are lines fitted with head points and feet points of each silhouettes , respectively .
 One is the vanishing line which is represented by MATH , the other is the perpendicular line of each silhouette .
 In other words , MATH coordinate of the center of transformation is the center of silhouette , MATH coordinate is identical to one of vanishing line .
 Therefore , the distortion of silhouette is minimized because the center of silhouette becomes the center of transformation without regard to the location of silhouette .
 In addition , MATH becomes identity matrix MATH because MATH coordinate value of MATH is the same as the one of the center of transformation .
 Using these variables , the TCPSP can be modeled by the following ILP : MATHDISP subject to : MATHDISP
 If outcomes in MATH refer to more nodes MATH -LRB- in the sense of Property REF -RRB- , then nodes MATH must be non mutually exclusive .

 A PPT MATH is a MATH - composable obfuscator for a circuit ensemble MATH if it satisfies the functionality and polynomial slow-down requirements , as in Definition REF , and for any poly-size binary adversary MATH and polynomial MATH , there is a simulator MATH , such that for any sequence of circuits MATH -LRB- where MATH -RRB- , and any sufficiently large MATH : MATHDISP , where MATH gets as input MATH and returns MATH .
 Essentially , bounded-UC security guarantees that security is preserved under unlimited non-concurrent composition , plus a limited form of concurrent composition .
 The size of MATH has in all tests been always less than MATH of the original problem size and this core problem is therefore solvable to optimality in very short time by the ILP solver .
 In order to further improve the quality of the heuristic solution , we perform then a local search phase that uses the optimal solution of the core problem as initial solution .
 Two feasible solutions MATH and MATH are neighbors if MATH , i.e. a job tardy and a job early are swapped .
 Let denote by MATH the solution value provided by the local search phase .
 We suggest the alternative terminology primitive black-box , to signify both that only the primitive -LRB- and not the adversary -RRB- is treated as a black-box , and that this is a `` cruder '' form of reduction .
 Note that in general primitive black-box constructions can not be ruled out without ruling out the existence of PRG , because if the latter exist a construction can just ignore the oracle and output a PRG .

 Normally one single URI should point to one single resource , and should remain unchanged over time .
 The 9/7 poly-DWT filter has higher hardware requirements and hence consumes more power than the 5/3 filter .
 Using the poly-DWT filter during active-usage time and switching to the 5/3 filter during idle-usage time will save us 0.12 W power .

 Autocorrelation structures on the service time of tasks lead to dependent service time .
 A slowly-decay autocorrelation structure on the aggregated service time forms a long-range dependence structure on task arrivals CITE .
 A long-range dependence structure is held in the dependent service time used in the validation shown in Figure REF -LRB- c -RRB- .
 The service time follows a process of fractional Gaussian noise -LRB- fGn -RRB- which is a Gaussian process with its autocorrelation function being expressed as -LRB- in CITE -RRB- MATHDISP where MATH is the lag of the autocorrelation and MATH measures the degree of the dependence structure .

 An approach often taken by designers of secure multiparty protocols for such applications is to arbitrarily choose one of the existing algorithms/heuristics for the search problem , and implement a secure protocol for it .
 This indeed amounts to choosing an arbitrary -LRB- possibly randomized -RRB- function that provides a solution , and implementing it securely .

 Alternatively , one could require the initial vector to be a multiple of MATH , and assuming the length of each message is less than MATH , this leads to a sequence of safe initial vectors .
 For the same optimizations to work even across messages , one can set IV MATH -LRB- see fig 2 -RRB- , and it is easy to see that this leads to safe initial vectors .
 In order to enable a Semantic SOA at Web scale , it is necessary to extend traditional service bus solutions with techniques to ease deployment , to cope with openness , dynamics and scalability in terms of services , service providers and consumers and certainly the resulting data and work load on the system .

 Our results show that it is possible to use a common interface for both dense and sparse data structures with a homogeneous coding style , and reducing the associated development cost comparing with manually coding the data structure management , its partition , and the communication of locally mapped subdomains when needed .
 Noticing this possibility , Bellare et al. propose another four-round protocol with fixed communication complexity , which has the property that relative to an oracle repeating the protocol any polynomial number of times in parallel , does not decrease the error .
 But it could be that parallel repetition does always reduce the error , and the reason why there is no proof of this is that such a proof would require non black-box techniques .
 In this paper we show that under standard assumptions the interpretation of Bellare et al. is indeed correct for protocols with eight rounds or more , and we strengthen the evidence that this is also true for protocols with four rounds .

 Given a group of message-signature pairs MATH -LRB- all purportedly from the same signer -RRB- where each message is distinct , BGLS aggregate them as MATH .
 Indeed , for some pervasive computing applications only guaranteeing screening would be disastrous , because only MATH may be relevant information to forward to the next entity-and it wo n't verify once it arrives !
 The sender could then later claim that he did not send one of the messages and indeed the signature will not verify unless one can get hold of all MATH messages !
 In this case in order to allow a solution the requirements have to be relaxed asking only that the constraints are verified as much as possible .

 Mandi , is a step towards this global vision and specifically designed to act as a flexible market supporting multiple negotiation protocols -LRB- such as auctions and commodity market -RRB- and pricing models .
 The true/false value determining the successor of a conditional instruction such as if then else , is typically not represented .
 Likewise , there are other pre-processing algorithms , that while they have not necessarily been applied yet in the context of reduced palette rendering , could be usefully incorporated .
 Examples include : saliency detection to control levels of abstraction CITE ; colorimetric correction to provide color constancy which will ensure more consistent and correct palettes ; colour harmonisation to produce more attractive palettes CITE ; depth estimation to control relighting and other stylisation effects CITE ; intrinsic image decomposition to extract shading and reflectance from an image to enable rendering to better capture the underlying scene characteristics , conversion from a colour image to grayscale whilst attempting to preserve the colour contrast in the grayscale image CITE .
 Divide-and-conquer strategy has been used in mining frequent itemsets .
 The specific algorithm is :
 When the conditions of HRR fields are not satisfied -LRB- elastic unloading and non-proportional plastic loading in cyclically loaded bodies -RRB- , the elastic J-integral is no longer valid to estimates the energy release rate ; in these cases , an appropriate evaluation of the ERR requires the determination of the crack tip-integral MATH with MATH shrinking onto the crack tip ; with the application of the finite element method -LRB- from a point of view of numerical simulations of quasi-static crack propagation -RRB- Eq . REF is no longer useful to assess a criterion of fracture .
 As this information relies on expensive psychophysical experiments a statistical metrics that could predict the results were analyzed .
 The results were successfully validated in an experiment with six additional materials and eighteen observers .
 Thus the continuous repartitioning approach given in section REF is no longer effective in this scenario .
 Although Fiedler did not give an optimal value of MATH for partitioning , the median of the Fiedler vector entries has been used in the literature extensively for this purpose .
 The integration process is extensible .
 Ontologies have been used for publishing information regarding data sources and for aligning it with business needs .
 Ontologies are extensible and thus allowed for the integration process to be easily extended with the change of business needs .
 A number of definitions of orthogonality in vector space were given in literature .
 To use these performance monitoring capabilities a simple custom library was developed .
 Suppose that five computational nodes MATH , MATH are selected from a grid resource topology .
 The computational ability for each node MATH is set to 100 , 200 , 400 , 500 , and 900 , respectively .
 The shrinking parameters MATH of all permutations are consistently set to the values shown in Table REF for fairness .
 Here for each occurrence MATH of variable MATH , we define , beside the machine MATH and the clause job , one auxiliary machine MATH and two auxiliary jobs : a job-shop-type consistency job MATH consisting of two unit-length operations that must be processed on machines MATH in a cyclic manner -LRB- i.e. , machine MATH coincides with MATH -RRB- ; and an open-shop-type assignment job MATH consisting of two operations -LRB- of length 2 and 1 -RRB- that must be respectively processed on machines MATH and MATH in an arbitrary order .
 The next property is the most important one introduced so far , it states that a transaction is certified -LRB- or discarded , respectively -RRB- in the same order at all available sites .
 Hence , one replica can be faster -LRB- i.e. process more messages -RRB- and certify more transactions .
 Thus MATHDISP
 Thus , we conclude that MATH is a Cauchy sequence in intuitionistic fuzzy Banach space .
 -LRB- REF -RRB- with MATH implies MATHDISP for all MATH and MATH .
 otherwise convert the TS tour to the just-in-time schedule MATH for MATH by ordering the jobs in MATH according to the order in which the cities are traversed in the TS tour .
 The last city to visit corresponds to MATH .
 given MATH , compute the schedule MATH for the original instance : the ordering of jobs remains unchanged and jobs in MATH are removed ;
 With the use of RBAC and ABAC , the privacy manager defines the privacy policies , privacy laws , user levels and security levels to control the data access .
 Thus , to describe an individual gait sufficiently , we adopt the Shape Sequence Descriptor -LRB- SSD -RRB- which describes shape information and variation caused by motion , simultaneously .
 In general , the SSD is used for recognizing motion which is presented by the fixed object , or person .
 Thus , it dose not be directly applied to the gait recognition because gait sequences is accompanied with positional change , and , all of features in the SSD is not significant to the gait recognition .
 Just like rewinding intervals , properties of composable blocks guarantee that a `` swap '' will generate a new good random tape ; moreover , these same properties are closed under composition-namely the swapping of one such block leaves other composable blocks intact , even if these composable blocks are not disjoint .
 Then , we define :
 -LRB- 1 -RRB- MATH .
 Because of this dependency and low computational cost of these other equalities , paralelization of other equalities is out of consideration here .
 Therefore , -LRB- REF -RRB- and -LRB- REF -RRB- are paralellized .
 Resonant antennas radiate generally a relatively pure polarization due to to clearly defined field or current distribution at the resonance frequency .
 During a broadband radiation the current distribution changes generally over the ferquency , which leads to higher cross-polarization level .
 One of these tapered slot antenna -LRB- also called Vivaldi Antenna -RRB- .
 In order to design a dual-polarized version of this radiator the crossing of two elements is needed CITE , CITE .
 Such solution resluts in an acceptable HF-performance , however the manufacturing is complicated and the devices are sensitive to the mechanical vibrations .
 For that reason another solution is introduced .
 It is easy to see that the above condition is not exact ; for instance any implicit-deadline sporadic task system MATH comprised of MATH tasks with MATH and MATH is -LRB- trivially -RRB- EDF-schedulable on MATH processors .
 Virtualization is the key feature of the Clouds , that allows improving the efficiency of large-scale distributed systems CITE .
 Note that this operation only returns one graph , of all available ones .
 It is possible to relax this approach , in order to remove only the local subsumptions that deeply change the semantics of an ontology , for instance , correspondences which cause two concepts to collapse or enforce a restriction as suggested in Wang et .

 Our results show that the relationship between universal composability and black-box simulatability is more subtle than previously described .
 In particular , composition theorems based on UC do not necessarily imply those based on blackbox simulatability over any computational model in which the forwarding property is not satisfied .
 This is illustrated in figure REF d where we have used a MATH window to compute the disparity map .
 The milp , clp-milp , clp-milps , and clps-milp achieved the value 138 , while the clp model obtained the sub-optimal value 142 after 2 MATH h -LRB- 7200 MATH s -RRB- of running .
 Thus the specification exercise encompasses more than one phase of the software life-cycle .
 Tab . REF summarizes the speedups on the MATH and on MATH .
 Proactive techniques : such techniques stick to the classical idea of building a global solution at generation time , which will never be reconsidered at execution time .
 generate one complete generic schedule which is proved to cover most cases , i.e. to execute correctly in most of the possible situations that will arise at execution time ,
 generate a flexible solution , i.e. in which some decisions have not been made and are postponed until execution time ,
 or generate a conditional solution , i.e. a solution in which various mutually exclusive decisions are developed , the one being effectively chosen being dependent on some condition which will only be observed at execution time .
 Denote by MATH the output of party MATH when MATH quits at round MATH before sending its message -LRB- that is , at round MATH only MATH broadcast its message -RRB- ; likewise , MATH denotes the output of MATH when MATH quits at round MATH .

 If MATH L-reduces to MATH and if there is a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for MATH with worst-case error MATH , then there is a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for MATH with worse-case error MATH .
 Extrapolation of the experimental data , backed up by our model , indicate that the attack has the potential to break up to 28 rounds with a chosen plaintext complexity less than MATH .
 HPC/scientific programmers approach to performance optimization almost always has involved profiling and , thus , profiling is considered as part of the optimization/parallelization process .

 As described in Section REF , there is an implicit run for each family at time 0 , so that the job-count starts there .
 Thus , Constraint -LRB- REF -RRB- starts from MATH .
 In both constraints -LRB- REF -RRB- and -LRB- REF -RRB- we need to enforce the condition that no setup is needed for the first job , and that the qual-run job-count starts at the beginning of the schedule .
 Next , constraint -LRB- REF -RRB- implies that the sum of processing time , setup time and qual-run time can not exceed the capacity -LRB- available time for processing -RRB- of the machine .
 Second , the key MATH is computed as MATH Notice that , the validity of MATH can be verified by first encrypting some random message MATH with respect to the public key MATH and then by checking if one can decrypt it correctly using MATH .
 This is true only for certain types of size , availability and composition type combinations .
 In-car scenarios Moritz Schack et al. , from Technische Universitat Braunschweig , presented measurements of the UWB channel inside several different cars CITE .
 A compromise between accuracy at disparity borders and accuracy at slanted surfaces is the truncated linear function , i.e. , MATH where MATH is a user-defined truncation value .
 The costs of using two jumps -LRB- from disparity 5 to 10 and from 10 to 15 -RRB- is 6 , while that of the single large jump -LRB- from 5 to 15 -RRB- is 3 , i.e , the single large jump is cheaper .
 Note that if MATH is an `` YES '' instance , then MATH and MATH - should have the form MATH and MATH of MATH entries ; otherwise , we have MATH .
 Remark A. 12 Lately , instead of Hyers 's direct method , fixed point theorems have also been widely used to obtain stability results for functional equations . -LRB- For the origins and some recent developments , see Baker CITE , Radu CITE , Mihet CITE , Park and Rassias CITE , P. G avruta and L. G avruta CITE , Takahasi , Miura and Takagi CITE . -RRB-
 So , in this step there are some communications and synchronization points among processes .
 The parameters have to be estimated numerically using some of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo -LRB- MCMC -RRB- methods for Bayesian or maximum likelihood estimates or a suitable simplifying approximation is to be applied -LRB- e.g. , the least square method or the maximum pseudo-likelihood method CITE -RRB- .
 The toroid shaped image index lattice is assumed to enable fast subspace factor synthesis from model parameters using inverse fast Fourier transformation -LRB- FFT -RRB- CITE .
 The analysis and synthesis of multispectral texture data-space using this method is very fast , however , the use of FFT somewhat restricts this method 's hardware implementation .
 The difference between text mining and structure search , both equally valuable in our opinion , is so great , that we can hardly point to any group that can do both .
 Moreover , the SM ca n't continue the execution of the protocol if the balance is lower than the fee to obtain MATH - receipts from GO , unless the SM 's balance is increased .
 The conventional scheme tries to simplify QoS provisioning by broadcast all TV channels to everywhere at all times no matter whether a channel is being viewed by the user .
 Thus , the proposed scheme tires to let each network node pre-join only a selection of channels , which consists of the active channels and a small number of inactive ones rather than every channel .
 Game 6 is the same as Game 5 , except that we change line D06 , as follows :
 The buffer manager has to replace free pages first to exploit intra-transaction locality .
 Let MATH be the ordering of MATH corresponding to a colourful feedback arc set MATH of MATH .
 Observe that since MATH is colourful , MATH must be the unique topological ordering of MATH .
 Levene and Peterson -LRB- Trail Records CITE -RRB- propose the use of a mobile device to record learning experiences using different media -LRB- for instance , text , video , and audio -RRB- while the visit in different locations .
 Using this lemma , proving a dense schedule satisfies the conjecture can be simplified to proving the existence of not-all-zero MATH - and MATH - values that make the inequality -LRB- 2 -RRB- hold .
 When road following algorithms is aimed at not only lane detection but also lane tracking , the temporal correlation between consecutive frames can be used either to ease the feature determination or to validate the result of the processing .
 Redmill it al. developed an image-based lane tracking system CITE , in which the geometry and width of the current lane ahead of the vehicle are estimated from frame by frame .
 Afterwards , the position and orientation of the vehicle are estimated w.r.t the center line between the two lanes .
 For a language MATH and complexity class MATH we say that MATH Poly if there is a polynomial advice function MATH , and a language MATH such that for all MATH , MATHDISP .
 The preceding equation is admissible considering Conditions REF and REF .
 Since there are MATH states from an initial state to a goal state along any path in the state space it averages to one node per state .
 To calculate the DRT of one node all the incoming edges to the node have to be checked which on average is the density of the task graph .
 The data ready time metric like the computation bottom level metric is useful for task graphs that are structured with medium to high number of edges .
 For the examples shown in the paper , this is the type of multi-pass thresholding that we apply .
 Filter methods :
 These employ schemes to select features without using the classifiers directly in the process ; for example features may be ranked based on correlation with the class labels .
 In this section we will define the terms that we use to describe our algorithm and show how we can use Markov chains to analyze the performance of many on-line bounded-space bin cover algorithms .
 We will not present any new results on Markov chains , but we will use the language of Markov chains to describe the on-line bounded-space bin cover problem .
 Markov chains provide a natural and intuitive way to formulate the on-line bounded-space bin cover problem .
 In the next section we will use the concepts from this section to design an algorithm for the on-line bounded-space bin cover problem .
 Since we are looking at a K-bounded-space algorithms , we can assume that we have , at all times , MATH open bins and write the level of these bins as a vector , called bin-state .
 Since we will only look at bins that have the same demand , we can reduce the number of possible bin-states by assuming that the they are sorted , i.e. for any bin state MATH we have that MATH for MATH .
 The scalability of Nornir using the Random benchmark described in section REF is shown in figure REF .
 This plot shows the absolute running times of a random graph with cycles at different values of MATH , whereas figure REF shows speedup over running time on 1 CPU .
 As MATH increases to 100 , the available parallelism in the network increases , and the running time decreases ; in figure REF we see that MATH achieves perfect speedup on multiple CPUs .
 This is caused by frequent deadlock detections , as witnessed by figure REF , which shows the number of started deadlock detections per second of running time .
 So the goal of protocol MATH is to enable the parties to check whether MATH has distributed the row polynomials in such a way that the MATH point on the row polynomials of at least MATH parties define polynomials of degree at most MATH .
 MATH that is MATH - th coefficient of the ART is computed as equation -LRB- REF -RRB- .
 MATH denotes the basis function computed as equation -LRB- REF -RRB- , where MATH is the angular component and MATH is the radial component .
 The ART coefficient is complex number because the angular component is complex number .
 Degrees of the ART coefficients MATH and MATH which are recommended in the MPEG7 standard are 3 and 12 , respectively , thus , the dimension of ART is 36 CITE .
 However , in this paper , we use MATH and MATH because the radial component is more dominant than the angular component for discrimination in gait silhouette .
 Figure REF shows the basis function of the ART , that is MATH in Eq . -LRB- REF -RRB- .

 The notion of universal one-way hash functions -LRB- UOWHFs -RRB- was introduced by Naor and Yung CITE who showed how to construct UOWHF primitives based on any 1-1 one-way function and proposed digital signature schemes based on UOWHFs .
 The UOWHFs were called Target collision resistant -LRB- TCR -RRB- hash functions by Bellare and Rogaway CITE , a notion which was also adopted by Halevi and Krawczyk CITE .
 Noticing that MATH due to lemma REF , we have MATH .
 In our experiments we selected two different coupling factor MATH and MATH .
 Furthermore , if there is no priori assumptions on possible test data that are expected , it is impossible to generalize and there is thus no better algorithm -LRB- any algorithm will be beaten by some other ones on certain kind of test data -RRB- .
 Therefore , one needs to make a reasonable assumption about the data before deriving learning algorithms and performing theoretical analysis on them .
 Finally , the encoded values are encrypted with proxy re-encryption by using 1248 bit key and frequencies of indexed keywords are encrypted with AES by using 256 bit key .

 The grammar of electronic test_request_form in Table REF , Chapter REF can be expanded in a top down manner to understand the user interaction points in its structure .
 Although the form may be used in different ways , a EFSM model can be given to constrain user interaction behavior in completing the electronic form in a manner that is consistent with the grammar .
 The purpose of user interaction points is to explicitly show the stages of user interaction , a prime concept in user interface design .
